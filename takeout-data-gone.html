    <h1>I've found Google Takeouts to silently remove old data</h1>
    <div class="summary">Crosspost from /r/DataHoarder</h2>
    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p>This is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ayt5cu/ive_found_out_google_takeout_archives_are_not/">crosspost</a> from Reddit.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: keep/backup your old Google Takeout archives, turns out the data is not persisted across them.</p>
<p>So I am working on a personal project for which I am collecting all the URLs I even visited. I update them via cron from multiple sources, in particular my latest Google Takeout archive which I‚Äôm always storing on my desktop. I‚Äôve been improving the resilience of the project in terms of making sure I don‚Äôt break URL extracion so I wrote a script to diff the extracted urls and check if any of them disappear. What I found out was that urls from takeout were in fact mysteriously disappearing.</p>
<p>After a bit of WTF and investigation, turned out that takeout data is not cumulative (at least for some of sources), and seems to have some sort of retention period.</p>
<p>Here are some of my findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>archive from 20181227</p>
<pre><code>  grep time_usec BrowserHistory.json | sort | head -n 3
            &quot;time_usec&quot;: 1513604826000563
            &quot;time_usec&quot;: 1513606272469876

<p>that takeout doesn‚Äôt have any of MyActivity.html (Google added it later in 2017) there is <code>Searches</code> directory which contains some jsons back to October 2010</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary: looks like <code>BrowserHistory.json</code> has got a retention of about 1 year, same for <code>Chrome/MyActivity.html</code>. <code>Search/MyActivity.html</code> has got a retention of about 3 years. It‚Äôs a mess.</p>
<p>Not sure if there is a similar issue with other takeout stuff (e.g.¬†youtube watch history, shopping, location etc), so be careful if you rely on it!</p>
<p>I guess it was sort of a gut feeling that I was paranoid about that and was keeping some of the older archives.</p>
<p>Also I haven‚Äôt really found anything about this retention anywhere in google takeout FAQ. Does anyone know about it? Is it some sort of legal requirement, a bug or something else?</p>
