<b>Draft stage</b>: mostly ready in terms of what I want to say and structure, writing needs to be improved.
</p>
<p>
<b>TLDR</b>: in this post I'm going to be looking at missed opportunities TODO engaging and interacting with your personal data and digital trace.
</p>
<p>
It might seem like a long rant, but I promise you I am not a kind of person who whines and vents just for the sake of it!
I'm just building up TODO pressure? and engaging you, and I do have some specific workarounds and suggestions. (TODO link to some existing tools?)
This article got long enough, so I will I will explain them in the second part.
(TODO also discussions could target different points)
</p>
<p>
TODO that's for second part?
I've exported/scraped/reverse engineered data from various sources and figured out the automation routine/infrastructure that works for me.
Some of the data I got proved to be more useful, some less useful, but nevertheless I decided to share my TODO findings??. Hopefully that would help someone else.

<p>
On one hand, in 2019 things are pretty great. 
For almost anything you wish to do on your computer/phone (TODO examples?) you'd find several apps, platforms and ecosystems that would handle your task in one way or another.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, typically, once the service has your data, it's <b>siloed and trapped</b>.
You are completely at the mercy of service developers and management. 
</p>
<p>
Within the same ecosystem (e.g. Google/Apple/Microsoft) you <b>might</b> get some integrations and interactions if the company spares them.
Apart from it, it's virtually non-existent.
We have TODO much data as ever, and it just sits there helpless.
</p>
<p>
Often UIs suck or have some inconveniences TODO, and don't TODO average, but leaves number of users who would be dissatisfied (and often these are power users).
</p>
<p>
Switching to new and unfamiliar tools is hard enough cognitively as it is.
In addition, in most cases you have to <b>leave behind</b> all your old data. 
You're lucky if you can do some sort of data import/export and if it works properly.
</p>
<p>
TODO ifttt which is a mediocre experience, capable of TODO very simple things and also requires cooperation with the service in the first place (TODO pinboard story <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt">https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt</a> )
</p>
<p>
Personal data in in a sad state these days. (TODO I won't be talking about privacy concerns here).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org000003b">
<h2 id="why"><a class="headerlink" href="#why">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Why does that bother you?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why">
<p>
To be fair, I don't understand how does that <b>not</b> bother you!
</p>
<p>
To start with, allow me to quote <a href="orger.html#intro">myself</a> here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I consume lots of digital content (books, articles, reddit, youtube, twitter, etc.) and most of it I find somewhat useful and insightful.
I want to use that knowledge later, act and build on it. But there's an obstacle: human brain.
</p>
<p>
It would be cool to be capable of always remembering and instantly recalling information you've interacted with, metadata and your thoughts on it.
Until we get augmented though, there are two options: first is just to suck it up and live with it. You might have guessed this is not the option I'm comfortable to take.
</p>
<div><span class="before-aside">
Second option is compensating for your sloppy meaty memory and having information you've read at hand and a quick way of searching over it. 

</span><aside class="sidenote">see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#extendedmind">#extendedmind</a></aside></div>
<p>
<a id="org0000018"></a>
That sounds simple enough but as with many simple things, on practice you run into obstacles. 
I'll give some I've personally been overcoming as examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>convenience of access, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to access highlights and notes on my Kobo ebook I need to actually <b>reach my reader and tap through e-ink</b> touch screen. Not much fun!</li>
<li><div><span class="before-aside">if you want to search over annotations in your PDF collections… well good luck, I'm just not aware of such a tool. It's actually way worse: many PDF viewers <b>wouldn't even let you search in highlights</b> within the file you're currently viewing. </span><aside class="sidenote">see PDF readers <a href="./annotating.html#pdfs">overview</a></aside></div></li>
<li>there is no easy way to quickly access all of your twitter favorites, people suggest using hacks like <a href="https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/131374/68104">autoscroll extension</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>searching data, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>search function often just isn't available at all, e.g. on Instapaper, you can't restrict search to highlights. If it is available, it's <b>almost never incremental</b>.</li>
<li>builtin browser search (<code class="inline">Ctrl-F</code>) sucks for the most part: it's not very easy to navigate as you don't get previews and you have to look through every match</li>
<li>sometimes you vaguely recall reading about something or seeing a link, but <b>don't remember where exactly</b>. Was it on stackoverflow? Or in some github issue? Or in a conversation with friend?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>data ownership and liberation, e.g.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
what happens if data disappears or service is down (temporary/permanently) or banned by your government?
</p>
<p>
You may think you live in a civilized country and that would never affect you. Well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387146/instapaper-gdpr-europe-access-shut-down-privacy-changes">in 2018</a>, Instapaper was unavailable in Europe for several months (!) due to missing the GDPR deadline.
</p></li>
<li><div><span class="before-aside">99% of services <b>don't have support for offline mode</b>. This may be just a small inconvenience if you're on a train or something, but there is more to it.
What if some sort of apocalypse happens and you lose all access to data? 
That depends on your paranoia level of course, and apocalypse is bad enough as it is, but my take on it is that at least I'd have my data :) </span><aside class="sidenote">see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#offline">#offline</a></aside></div></li>
<li>if you delete a book on Kobo, not only you can't access its annotations anymore, but they seem to get <b>wiped</b> from the database.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
So as you can see, my main frustrations are around the lack of the very basic things that computers can do <b>extremely</b> well: data retrieval and search.
</p>
<p>
I'll carry on, just listing some examples. Let's see if any of them resonate with you:

There is another aspect to this: your data is <b>slipping away</b>.
</p>
<p>
TODO I feel especially strong about it as I consider part of me TODO extended mind?
</p>
<p>
Privacy concerns are important and it's understandable when people are pissed about services keeping hold of their data instead of properly wiping it.
</p>
<p>
However, often opposite is the case and you find that your data is gone or very hard to access:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Google Takout data, that is, all your browser activity, Youtube watch history, etc., are only kept by Google for <a href="./takeout-data-gone.html">few years</a></li>
<li>Chrome browser deletes history older than <a href="https://superuser.com/a/364475/300795">90 days</a></li>
<li>Firefox browser expires history based on some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Places_Expiration">magic algorithm</a></li>

</ul>
<p>
The problems above are sort of technical and in theory, can be solved by the companies that hold the data. There is another side to vanishing data:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>information is generally <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Archiving-URLs#link-rot">rotting away</a> from the Internet</li>
<li><p>

<p>
While people have right to delete their data from the Internet, arguably it doesn't extend to derived content or thoughts that you had on it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
I want all my problems and inconveniences magically solved, but I live in real world that's not gonna happen.
So let me be more specific: I argue that one <b>major</b> reason these tools and integration I want don't exist is that people don't have easy access to their data in the first place.
</p>
<p>
"Easy" is used here in two senses:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
easy for humans to look at and browse through (TODO example of good interfaces?)
</p>
<p>
This bit is hard in practice as (typically) the more something machine friendly the less it's human friendly.
</p></li>
<li><p>
easy for programmers to manipulate, analyse and interact TODO?
</p>
<p>
Let's concetrate on this part for now. If this is solved, that automatically enables engineers to develop human-friendly tools.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
So how would 'easy access to data' look in ideal world?
Let me present you my speculations on it, and I would be happy to hear your opinions on it!
</p>
<p>
Practically, easiest way to access data as of today, is when it's already on your filesystem.
(TODO in your RAM would be even better, but that's a whole different story…)
(TODO even easier when it's already in your interpreter in abstract form, but it's a bit too much.)
</p>
<p>
Whether it's plaintext, sqlite or some sort of binary data – doesn't matter, already having it locally saves you from the whole class of problems (TODO link to later section).

<p>
Okay, so hopefully we can agree that the current situation isn't so great.
But I am a software enginner. And chances that if you're reading it, you're very likely a programmer as well. Surely we can deal with that, right?
</p>
<p>
Kind of, but it's <b>really</b> hard to retrieve data created by you.
</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
By 'liberating' in this context I mean retreiving your personal data to your local storage, hopefully in automated way.
</p>
<p>
On the first glance it doesn't look like a big deal. It's just data, right? Every programmer should be capable of extrating it, right?
</p>
<p>
This is until you realise you're probably using at least ten different online services and they all have different purposes,
kinds of data, endpoints and restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Even if you have the capacity and willing to do it, it's still damn hard:
</p>
<p>
Let's assume an <b>optimistic</b> scenario, when the service has a public API. You're gonna have to deal with the following problems:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
authorisation
</p>
<p>
That's where it all starts with and it's a mess.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>easiest scenario: service lets you generate an API token from its settings and you can just use it after that. Example: <a href="https://pinboard.in">pinboard</a></li>
<li><p>
typical scenario: you need to do the whole <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified">Oauth</a> thing. 
</p>
<p>
That involves creating a client app, getting client id, dealing with scopes and redirect urls, etc.
Pretty tedious, and you certainly don't expect a <b>nonprogrammer</b> to be able to do these steps.
</p>
<p>
Examples: almost every service with an API out there: Twitter/Instapaper/Pocket/Githubetc.
</p></li>
<li><p>
worst scenario: the service doesn't even offer a public API. That also has different grades of horrible:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
best worst: service uses private API and you can spy on the token web app is using in browser dev tools.
</p>
<p>
Not too bad, but bit dubious.
</p>
<p>
Example: Pocket API doesn't give you away highlights unless you <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/pockexport#setting-up">mess with it</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
typical worst: no private API, so you need to scrape the data. Sometimes you can grab the cookies from browser dev tools and use them to access your data.
</p>
<p>
Scraping is orders of magnitude flakier, involves nasty parsing and obviously fragile.
Also some services might even actively prevent you from doing so by banning unusual user agents.
</p>
<p>
Examples: <a href="https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#sessions">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/blinkist-backup">Blinkist</a>
</p></li>
<li><p>
worst worst: you need to scrape the data and cookies don't work or expire often.
</p>
<p>
Basically that means you need to use your username/password. Bonus points if there is 2-factor auth involved. TODO FIXME examples
</p>
<p>
TODO Potentially you're going to store your password somewhere which is way less secure than using a token.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
All of the 'worst scenarios' are extremely flaky and basically impossible for nonprogrammers to use.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
pagination (TODO link)
</p>
<p>
Whether you're using API or not, typically you'll have to retrieve multiple chunks of data and merge them after.
</p>
<p>
It's not hard to implement it in principle, on one off basis, but unclear how to do it in some universal way because there is no common standard.
</p>
<p>
Pages might be retrieved as page numbers and counts on each page, offsets from start/end of data, before/after (ideal scenario), or with respect to timestamps.
</p>
<p>
It's quite error prone: content might change under your feet, and if the API developers or you are not careful, you might end up with missing data or even some logical corruption.
</p></li>
<li><p>
rate limiting (TODO link)
</p>
<p>
No one likes their API hammered, fair enough.
However, rate limits often vary from API endpoint to endpoint and inherently tedious to get right.
</p>
<p>
If you're not using API, you might get banned by ddos prevention (e.g. Cloudflare) if you're not careful.
</p>
<p>
Overall, painful and not fun to implement.
</p></li>
<li><p>
error handling
</p>
<p>
Authorisation, network, serializing, parsing, storing, synchronizing. 
There are among the most common error sources (as in, actual unrecoverable errors, not necessarily bugs) in software engineering generally, and getting it right is required for getting your data.
(TODO link to error handling post)
</p>
<p>
In addition, you want to be somewhat semi-defensive, and this is the hardest kind of error handling:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you want to progress eventually while running your data export</li>
<li>you want to make sure it only fails in completely unrecoverable scenarios, otherwise it's going to require constant tending</li>
<li>and you want to somehow let user know of problems/suspicious data</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
documentation and discovery
</p>
<p>
If you want <b>all</b> your data, you have to look carefully though the whole documentation and make sure you've got it all covered.
</p>
<p>
If the service adds some new endpoints, you might never find that out.
</p></li>
<li><p>
abstract representation
</p>
<p>
Having raw export data (e.g. sqlite database/json file/etc) is nice, but to actually use it you need an abstract representation.
You basically have to reinvent whatever the service developer does on backend already. 
</p>
<p>
Notable examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>unclear which data types to choose (nullable/non-nullable)</li>
<li>timestamps: zillions of string formats which you need to parse; figuring out whether it was UTC or not, parse it (I had to do it so often that I even memorized the wrong argument order in <code class="inline">datetime.strptime</code>)</li>
<li>which situations are valid, e.g. can id be used as a dictionary key, can you assume that they are increasing, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Now, some examples of more messed up scenarios:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
app data on your phone: often kept
</p>
<p>
E.g. on android apps keep their data in <code class="inline">/data/data/</code> directory, by default which isn't accessible without root. 
</p>
<p>
Very few apps support automatic data exports, 
</p>
<p>
TODO e.g. temp. sensor as example? I had something else?
TODO e.g. headspace data
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
There are more difficulties:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>TODO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">vendor lock</a></li>
<li><p>
lack of infrastructure (TODO this will be in the next section)
</p>
<p>
Some of us can afford keeping a VPS or TODO computer??
</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
Now, remember when I said it was tedious for programmers? 
Constant boilerplace, shitty APIs, latency, flakiness, etc. 
</p>
<p>
Now think about ordinary people who have no clue what 'API' is.
They deserve to use their data too.

<p>
Ideally, I'd just magically somehow have a programming interface to my data and use it in whatever way I want.
I don't live in a fairy tale however, so I've been thinking about more realistic ways that are possible with current technology.
</p>
<p>
The way I see it, ideally the online service you're using provides you with:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
a <b>data mirror app</b> that runs in background and continuously or regularly sucks in and synchronises backend data to the latest state 
</p>
<p>
Ideally this would be exactly the same state that backend uses, although in practice it would be hard at the very least for effeciency reasons.
(e.g. it's faster to keep data in the same database instead of creating a database for each user)
</p>
<p>
TODO list what that solves  
</p>
<p>
Shouldn't be too resource demanding, e.g. push notifications basically already do that, but in a less effecient way.
</p>
<p>
Data mirror should dump data in open machine-readable format like sqlite database/json/etc.
</p>
<p>
TODO link to original problems
TODO would be nice to have arrows for intrapage links?
</p>
<p>
This solves:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>authorisation: however tedious it's to implement, can be handled by the service developers.
They can make it as secure as necessary (e.g. 2FA/etc), ideally you log onto it once and then it just keeps the token.</li>
<li>pagination/rate limiting: non-problems essentially, especially considering that it's easier for developers to implement incremental data fetching</li>
<li>error handling: also developer's responsibility, and they would know better which situations are programming bugs and which have to be handled carefully</li>
<li>documentation and discovery: hopefully developers are better suited to keep their internal representations and exports consistent (even incentivised as it allows to write less code)</li>
<li>backups: will still to be done by external means, however it TODO simplifies massively, you just point you backup tool at your data vault.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<b>minimalistic data bindings</b> in some reasonable programming language that represent all of this data.
</p>
<p>
Specific programming language doesn't matter, it's a trivial, almost automatic, task to map data from one language to another.
</p>
<p>
providing some basic TODO understanding? types, sanity
TODO how would bindings play along with atomicity?
</p>
<p>
Data bindings need to reconstruct the state TODO and ideally be decoupled.
</p>
<p>
This to some extent solves the abstract representation issue.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
That's kinda naive and perhaps oversimplified view.
But to be honest we're so far away from that, that even some steps towards it would be a massive progress
</p>
<p>
TODO FIXME actually summarise more specific problems I'm targeting, I only listed examples
</p>
<p>
TODO demonstrate how hard it is on a simple example? e.g. telethon could be interesting?
</p>
<p>
Some caveats with these suggestions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
this particular suggestion might be hard to implement for <b>every user</b>
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, service developers would have more control on data access patterns, so in a way it might work better.
</p>
<p>
It would definitely be more effecient than other people writing cludgy tools to export and backup data.  
</p>
<p>
TODO better locality?
</p></li>
<li>'Average' users often are not motivated enough to demand such things</li>
<li><p>
Services have little motivation to promote this, as siloing and having monopoly on the client apps (e.g. web UI) keeps users on your platform even if you suck
</p>
<p>
TODO with the rise of distributed/federated services that would improve?
