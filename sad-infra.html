<b>TLDR</b>: in this post I'm going to be exploring <a class="link-down" href="#why">missed opportunities</a> at engaging and interacting with your personal data and digital trace,
and speculating on <a class="link-down" href="#exports_are_hard">why is it that way</a> and <a class="link-down" href="#data_mirror">how to make it easier</a>.
</p>
<p>
It might seem like a long rant, but I promise you I am not a kind of person who whines and vents just for the sake of it!
</p>
<p>
In this particular post I'm just building up motivation and engaging you, and I <a class="link-down" href="#what_do_i_do">do have</a> some workarounds and suggestions.
This article got long enough, so I will explain them in detail in the second part.
</p>
<p>
I also didn't want to mix discussions on motivation (this one) and my take on implementation (which will follow).

<h2 id="data_is_trapped"><a class="headerlink" href="#data_is_trapped">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Intro: your data is trapped</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-data_is_trapped">
<p>
Note: for clarity, I will use <b>'service' to refer to anything holding your data</b> and manipulating it, whether it's a website, phone app or a device (i.e. not necessarily something having online presence).
</p>
<p>
On one hand, in 2019 things are pretty great. 
For almost anything you wish to do on your computer or phone, you'd find several apps, platforms and ecosystems that would handle your task in one way or another.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, typically, once the service has your data, it's <b>siloed and trapped</b>.
You are completely at the mercy of service's developers and management. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Within the same ecosystem (e.g. Google/Apple/Microsoft) you might get some integrations and interactions if the company spares them.
Apart from these, <b>integrations are virtually non-existent</b>.
</p>
<p>
We have so much data, yet it just sits there doing nothing.
</p>
<p>
Now and then <a href="https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self#applications-and-platforms">some startup</a> pops up that connects together couple of APIs for a fee.
I don't want to pick on startups but typically it's something trivial like displaying calories consumed from your food tracker app on the same plot with calories burnt from your fitness tracker.
Trivial is okay, and I do acknowledge it's way harder to implement than it looks (I even <a class="link-down" href="#exports_are_hard">explore why later</a>).
The actually sad thing is that as a user, you're lucky if you use the right kind of fitness tracker that the service supports, or if you agree with their analysis methodology. Otherwise, sorry!
</p>
<p>
There are also services like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> which offer pretty primitive integrations and also require cooperation from all parties:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11378278">My Heroic and Lazy Stand Against IFTTT (Pinboard)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19458172">Google removing Gmail access from IFTTT</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Often UIs have some inconveniences (or just plain suck), which are often fine for an average user (aka KPIs),
but leaves number of users who are dissatisfied (and often these are power users).
</p>
<p>
In essence, services fully control the way they present you information.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it's a free market, just switch to other/better service, right? 
Switching to new and unfamiliar tools is hard enough cognitively as it is, but what's worst is that in most cases you have to <b>leave behind</b> all your old data. 
You're lucky if you can do some sort of data import/export and if it works properly.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Personal data is in a sad state these days. Let me elaborate.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org0000043">
<h2 id="why"><a class="headerlink" href="#why">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Why does that bother me?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why">
<style>.outline-4 h4              { font-weight: normal; } </style>
<style>.outline-4 .outline-text-4 { margin-left: 1em; color: #666; } </style>
<p>
To be fair, I don't understand how does that <b>not</b> bother you!
</p>
<p>
To start with, allow me to quote <a href="orger.html#intro">myself</a> here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I consume lots of digital content (books, articles, Reddit, Youtube, Twitter, etc.) and most of it I find somewhat useful and insightful.
I want to use that knowledge later, act and build on it. But there's an obstacle: human brain.
</p>
<p>
It would be cool to be capable of always remembering and instantly recalling information you've interacted with, metadata and your thoughts on it.
Until we get augmented though, there are two options: first is just to suck it up and live with it. You might have guessed this is not the option I'm comfortable to take.
</p>
<div><span class="before-aside">
Second option is compensating for your sloppy meaty memory and having information you've read at hand and a quick way of searching over it. 

</span><aside class="sidenote">see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#extendedmind">#extendedmind</a></aside></div>
<p>
<a id="org000001f"></a>
That sounds simple enough but as with many simple things, on practice you run into obstacles. 
I'll give some I've personally been overcoming as examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>convenience of access, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to access highlights and notes on my Kobo ebook I need to actually <b>reach my reader and tap through e-ink</b> touch screen. Not much fun!</li>
<li><div><span class="before-aside">if you want to search over annotations in your PDF collections… well good luck, I'm just not aware of such a tool. It's actually way worse: many PDF viewers <b>wouldn't even let you search in highlights</b> within the file you're currently viewing. </span><aside class="sidenote">see PDF readers <a href="./annotating.html#pdfs">overview</a></aside></div></li>
<li>there is no easy way to quickly access all of your twitter favorites, people suggest using hacks like <a href="https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/131374/68104">autoscroll extension</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>searching data, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>search function often just isn't available at all, e.g. on Instapaper, you can't restrict search to highlights. If it is available, it's <b>almost never incremental</b>.</li>
<li>builtin browser search (<code class="inline">Ctrl-F</code>) sucks for the most part: it's not very easy to navigate as you don't get previews and you have to look through every match</li>
<li>sometimes you vaguely recall reading about something or seeing a link, but <b>don't remember where exactly</b>. Was it on stackoverflow? Or in some github issue? Or in a conversation with friend?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>data ownership and liberation, e.g.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
what happens if data disappears or service is down (temporary/permanently) or banned by your government?
</p>
<p>
You may think you live in a civilized country and that would never affect you. Well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387146/instapaper-gdpr-europe-access-shut-down-privacy-changes">in 2018</a>, Instapaper was unavailable in Europe for several months (!) due to missing the GDPR deadline.
</p></li>
<li><div><span class="before-aside">99% of services <b>don't have support for offline mode</b>. This may be just a small inconvenience if you're on a train or something, but there is more to it.
What if some sort of apocalypse happens and you lose all access to data? 
That depends on your paranoia level of course, and apocalypse is bad enough as it is, but my take on it is that at least I'd have my data :) </span><aside class="sidenote">see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#offline">#offline</a></aside></div></li>
<li>if you delete a book on Kobo, not only you can't access its annotations anymore, but they seem to get <b>wiped</b> from the database.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
So as you can see, my main frustrations are around the lack of the very basic things that computers can do <b>extremely well</b>: data retrieval and search.
</p>
<p>
I'll carry on, just listing some examples. Let's see if any of them resonate with you:

I think all of this is pretty sad. Note that I haven't mentioned any mad science fiction stuff like tapping directly into the brain (as much as I wish it was possible).
All these things are totally doable with the <b>technology we already possess</b>.

I wonder what computing pioneers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart#Career_and_accomplishments">Douglas Engelbart</a>

And companies are <b>actively</b> promoting these silos.

Things I listed above are frustrating enough as they are.
There is another aspect to this: your data is <b>slipping away</b>.
</p>
<p>
Privacy concerns are important and it's understandable when people are pissed about services keeping hold of their data instead of properly wiping it.
</p>
<p>
However, often opposite is the case and you find that your data is gone or very hard to access:

The problems above are sort of technical and in theory, can be solved by some engineering. There is another side to vanishing data:

<li><p>

</p>
<p>
While people have right to delete their data from the Internet, arguably it doesn't extend to derived content like comments or thoughts that you had on it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what_do_i_want">
<p>
I want all these inconveniences somehow solved, but I live in real world and that's not gonna magically happen.
So let me be more specific: I argue that one <b>major</b> reason these tools and integration I want don't exist is that people don't have easy uniform access to their data in the first place.
</p>
<p>
"Easy" is used here in two senses:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b>easy for humans</b> to look at and browse through
</p>
<p>
This bit is hard in practice as (typically) the more something machine friendly the less it's human friendly.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>easy for programmers</b> to manipulate, analyze and interact with
</p>
<p>
Let's concentrate on this part for now. If this is solved, it automatically enables programmers to develop human-friendly tools.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
So how would 'easy access to data' look in ideal world?
Let me present you my speculations on it, and I would be happy to hear your opinions on it!
</p>
<p>
I want <b>an API</b> that I can query and get any of my personal data.
In ideal world it wouldn't really matter where the data is and it could be a web API.
</p>
<p>
However, realistically, as of today, easiest way to quickly access your data and more importantly, play with it, is when it's <b>already on your filesystem</b>.
</p>
<div><span class="before-aside">
Whether it's plaintext, sqlite or some sort of binary data – doesn't matter, already having it locally saves you from the whole class of problems (which I'm about to pinpoint in the following section).

</span><aside class="sidenote">even better if it's already in your RAM and interpreter, but that's a bit too much to wish at this point.</aside></div>
<p>
As you probably noticed, it's almost never the case that you have your personal data locally at hand. You need to spend extra effort to achieve this.

Okay, so hopefully we can agree that the current situation isn't so great.
But I am a software engineer. And chances that if you're reading it, you're very likely a programmer as well. Surely we can deal with that and implement, right?
</p>
<p>
Kind of, but it's <b>really hard</b> to retrieve data created by you.

<p>
At the first glance it doesn't look like a big deal. It's just data, right? Every programmer should be capable of getting it from the API, right?
</p>
<p>
This is until you realize you're probably using at least ten different services, and they all have different purposes,
kinds of data, endpoints and restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Even if you have the capacity and willing to do it, it's still damn hard:
</p>
<p>
You're gonna have to deal with the following problems:

<h3 id="org000000c"><a class="headerlink" href="#org000000c">¶</a>authorization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000000c">
<p>
That's where it all starts with and it's a mess.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>easiest scenario: service lets you generate an API token from its settings and you can just use it after that. Example: <a href="https://pinboard.in">pinboard</a></li>
<li><p>
typical scenario: you need to do the whole <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified">Oauth</a> thing. 
</p>
<p>
That involves creating a client app, getting client id, dealing with scopes and redirect urls, etc.
Pretty tedious, and you certainly don't expect a <b>nonprogrammer</b> to be able to follow these steps.
</p>
<p>
Examples: almost every service with an API out there: Twitter/Instapaper/Pocket/Github/etc.
</p></li>
<li><p>
worst scenario: the service doesn't even offer a public API. That also has different grades of horrible:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
best worst: service uses private API and you can spy on the token web app is using in browser dev tools.
</p>
<p>
Not too bad, but bit dubious.
</p>
<p>
Example: Pocket API doesn't give you away highlights unless you <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/pockexport#setting-up">mess with it</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
typical worst: no private API, so you need to scrape the data. Sometimes you can grab the cookies from browser dev tools and use them to access your data.
</p>
<p>
Scraping is orders of magnitude flakier, involves nasty parsing and obviously fragile.
Also some services might even actively prevent you from doing so by banning unusual user agents.
</p>
<p>
Examples: <a href="https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#sessions">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/blinkist-backup">Blinkist</a>
</p></li>
<li><p>
worst worst: you need to scrape the data and cookies don't work or expire often.
</p>
<p>
Basically that means you need to use your username/password. Bonus points if there is 2-factor auth involved.
</p>
<p>
Potentially that means you're going to store your password somewhere which is way less secure than using a token.
</p>
<p>
Example: <a href="https://takeout.google.com">Google Takeout</a> exports are not only asynchronous, but also don't have an API so you have to login in order to export.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
All the 'worst' scenarios are extremely flaky and basically impossible for nonprogrammers to use.

Whether you're using API or not, typically you'll have to retrieve multiple chunks of data and merge them after.
</p>
<p>
It's not hard to implement it in principle, on one off basis, but unclear how to do it in some universal way because there is no common standard.
</p>
<p>
Pages might be addressed by page numbers and counts, offsets from start/end of data, before or after with respect to ids or timestamps, etc.
</p>
<p>
It's quite error prone: content might change under your feet, and if the API developers or you are not careful, you might end up with missing data or even some logical corruption.

If you simply start fetching a json and writing to disk, you'd very quickly end up with a corrupt file on the first network failure.
You've gotta be really careful and ensure atomic writing and updating.

No one likes their API hammered, fair enough.

There are among the most common error sources (as in, actual unrecoverable errors, not necessarily bugs) in software engineering generally, and getting it right is required for reliably retrieving your data.

In addition, you want to be somewhat <b>semi-defensive</b>, and this is the hardest kind of error handling:

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-data_mirror">
<p>
The way I see it, ideally the service you're using provides you with:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
a <b>data mirror</b> app
</p>
<p>
Best case scenario is if the service is <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">local-first</a> in the first place.
However, this may be a long way ahead and there are certain technical difficulties associated with such designs.
</p>
<p>
I'm suggesting a data mirror app, that merely runs in background on client side
and continuously/regularly sucks in and synchronizes backend data to the latest state.
</p>
<p>
Ideally this would be exactly the same state that backend uses, although in practice it would be hard at the very least for efficiency reasons
(e.g. it's faster for the backend to keep data in the same database instead of separate databases for each user).
</p>
<p>
It shouldn't be too resource demanding for the backend, e.g. data sync via push notifications basically already does that, but even in a less efficient way.
</p>
<p>
Data mirror should dump data in open machine-friendly format like json/sqlite database/etc.
</p>
<p>
This solves:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
authorization: however tedious it's to implement, can be handled by the service's developers.

<p>
They can make it as secure as necessary (e.g. 2FA/etc), as long as you log onto it once and it keeps the token.
</p></li>
<li>pagination/consistency/rate limiting: non-problems essentially, especially considering that it's easier for service's developers to implement incremental data fetching</li>
<li>error handling: also developer's responsibility, and they would know better which situations are programming bugs and which have to be handled carefully</li>
<li>documentation and discovery: hopefully developers are better suited to keep their internal representations and exports consistent (even incentivised as it allows to write less code)</li>
<li>backups: will still have to be done by external means, but it simplifies the task massively, you just need to point you backup tool at your data storage</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
minimalistic <b>data bindings</b> in some reasonable programming language that represent all of this data.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, specific language doesn't matter, it's a trivial, almost automatic, task to map data from one language to another.
</p>
<p>
This solves:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>parsing: developers know better how to get it right; in addition the code can potentially be shared with the backend</li>
<li>abstract representation: would massively lower the barrier for integrating and interacting with data</li>
<li>offline: if you have all data locally you've got efficient access without latency and need for extra error handling</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
That's perhaps a naive and oversimplified view.
But to be honest we're so far away from that, that even some small steps towards would be quite a progress.
</p>
<p>
These suggestions would <b>decouple data from UI</b> and let the community develop better tools for consuming and working with it.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000016">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
this might be <b>hard to support</b> for everyone
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, service developers would have more control on data access patterns, so in a way it might work better.
</p>
<p>
It would definitely be more efficient than third parties writing kludgy tools to export and backup data.  
</p>
<p>
In addition, for some services and scenarios, it would give better data locality and lower latencies.
</p></li>
<li><p>
'average' users often are <b>not motivated enough</b> to demand such things
</p>
<p>
In particular, not everyone has or willing to set up necessary infrastructure to run all these things.
</p>
<p>
However, if implemented properly, there is absolutely nothing preventing running data mirror on your laptop or even phone.
It really doesn't require much CPU or bandwidth if you support incremental updates.
</p></li>
<li><p>
services have little motivation to promote this, <b>silos benefit them</b>
</p>
<p>
Having monopoly on the client interface (e.g. web UI) keeps users on your platform even if you suck.
</p>
<p>
If anyone can implement a better interface, there would be little opportunity for stuff like ads, and only way for the service to make money
would be to take a fee for data collection and serving. (which I personally will be happy to pay)
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Hopefully all of these issues would be solved by distributed/federated services, but we're pretty far from it.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000017">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
deleted content
</p>
<p>
E.g. imagine you liked someone's post on Facebook, that fact data got mirrored locally, and then the author removed the post.
</p>
<p>
What's the right thing to do for the data mirror app?
Should it erase just the post you liked from your data mirror?
Should it keep the fact that you liked it at all?
</p>
<p>
You may disagree with the way such a policy imposed by the service, hence implement additional logic to keep more data,
and at that point it seems like a matter for legal debate.
</p></li>
<li><p>
synchronizing data
</p>
<p>
If you want to access data from multiple devices, you either have to run multiple mirrors, which would be a bit of a hassle, or use some continuous sync service like Dropbox or <a href="https://syncthing.net">Syncthing</a>.
</p>
<p>
That however might not be so atomic, depending on the way data is kept on the disk, since files might be pulled in random or lexicographic order, depending on sync configuration.
</p></li>
<li><p>
protecting the data
</p>
<p>
Even if you don't trust your average startup at securing your data, it might be even less safe on average user's disk.
</p></li>
<li><p>
it's assuming that tools/integrations are open source and running on computers you own.
</p>
<p>
Realistically, closed source tools do exist and it's understandable when people want money for their efforts.
</p>
<p>
From user's perspective not everyone wants the hassle of running things locally either and many people are happy with online services for the most part.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what_do_i_do">
<p>
Of course, I'm not expecting someone going to come and implement all of this for me.
I could start some sort of movement to demand it from services and platforms, but I hardly see it working.
</p>
<p>
So I've spent effort into exporting, integrating and utilizing my data on my own according to the suggestions I formulated.
Putting this in writing helped me motivate and summarize many technical and infrastructural decisions.
</p>
<p>
I'll be describing my setup in more details in future posts, however here are some bits and pieces:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000018">
<p>
This corresponds to the 'data mirror' bit.
</p>
<p>
I exported/scraped/reverse engineered pretty much all of my digital trace and figured out automation and infrastructure that works for me.
</p>
<p>
I've shared <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=topic%3Aexport+++user%3Akarlicoss&amp;type=Repositories">some</a> of my personal export scripts and tools.
</p>
<p>
I also have some helper scripts to keep individual exporter's code as clean as possible while ensuring exports are reliable.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned, I'll share all of this later in a separate post.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000019">
<p>
Each data exporter comes with minimal bindings that merely map json/sqlite export into simple datatypes and data classes.
</p>
<p>
That way anyone who wishes to use data can kick off some reasonable representation, which is not overfitted to my specific needs.
</p>
<p>
Higher level querying and access, specific to myself is implemented in <a href="mypkg.html#examples">my.</a> package (note that this post is still in draft stage).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/my"><code class="inline">my.</code></a> package allows me to query my data from anywhere, enabling me to use familiar data processing, analysis and visualization tools, and enabling various integrations.
</p>
<p>
As a nice byproduct I've also finally figured out a reliable way to deal with <a href="mypy-error-handling.html">error handling in Python</a>.

I'd be interested to know your opinion or questions, whether on my motivation, or particularities of my suggestions or implementation.

<p>
Let me know if you can think of any other data integrations you are missing and perhaps we can think of something together!
