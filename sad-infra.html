<b>Draft stage</b>: mostly ready in terms of content and what I want to say, writing needs to be improved.
</p>
<p>
<b>TLDR</b>: in this post I'm going to be looking at missed opportunities TODO engaging and interacting with your personal data and digital trace.
</p>
<p>
It might seem like a long rant, but I promise you I am not a kind of person who whines and vents just for the sake of it!
I'm just building up TODO pressure? and engaging you, and I do have some specific workarounds and suggestions. (TODO link to some existing tools?)
This article got long enough, so I will I will explain them in the second part.
(TODO also discussions could target different points)
</p>
<p>
TODO that's for second part?
I've exported/scraped/reverse engineered data from various sources and figured out the automation routine/infrastructure that works for me.
Some of the data I got proved to be more useful, some less useful, but nevertheless I decided to share my TODO findings??. Hopefully that would help someone else.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
On one hand, in 2019 things are pretty great. 
For almost anything you wish to do on your computer/phone (TODO examples?) you'd find several apps, platforms and ecosystems that would handle your task in one way or another.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, typically, once the service has your data, it's <b>siloed and trapped</b>.
You are completely at the mercy of service developers and management. 
</p>
<p>
Within the same ecosystem (e.g. Google/Apple/Microsoft) you <b>might</b> get some integrations and interactions if the company spares them.
Apart from it, it's virtually non-existent.
We have TODO much data as ever, and it just sits there helpless.
</p>
<p>
Often UIs suck or have some inconveniences TODO, and don't TODO average, but leaves number of users who would be dissatisfied (and often these are power users).
</p>
<p>
Switching to new and unfamiliar tools is hard enough cognitively as it is.
In addition, in most cases you have to <b>leave behind</b> all your old data. 
You're lucky if you can do some sort of data import/export and if it works properly.
</p>
<p>
TODO ifttt which is a mediocre experience, capable of TODO very simple things and also requires cooperation with the service in the first place (TODO pinboard story <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt">https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt</a> )
</p>
<p>
Personal data in in a sad state these days. (TODO I won't be talking about privacy concerns here).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org0000043">
<h2 id="why"><a class="headerlink" href="#why">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Why does that bother you?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why">
<p>
To be fair, I don't understand how does that <b>not</b> bother you!
</p>
<p>
To start with, allow me to quote <a href="orger.html#intro">myself</a> here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I consume lots of digital content (books, articles, reddit, youtube, twitter, etc.) and most of it I find somewhat useful and insightful.
I want to use that knowledge later, act and build on it. But there's an obstacle: human brain.
</p>
<p>
It would be cool to be capable of always remembering and instantly recalling information you've interacted with, metadata and your thoughts on it.
Until we get augmented though, there are two options: first is just to suck it up and live with it. You might have guessed this is not the option I'm comfortable to take.
</p>
<div><span class="before-aside">
Second option is compensating for your sloppy meaty memory and having information you've read at hand and a quick way of searching over it. 

</span><aside class="sidenote">see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#extendedmind">#extendedmind</a></aside></div>
<p>
<a id="org0000024"></a>
That sounds simple enough but as with many simple things, on practice you run into obstacles. 
I'll give some I've personally been overcoming as examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>convenience of access, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to access highlights and notes on my Kobo ebook I need to actually <b>reach my reader and tap through e-ink</b> touch screen. Not much fun!</li>
<li><div><span class="before-aside">if you want to search over annotations in your PDF collections… well good luck, I'm just not aware of such a tool. It's actually way worse: many PDF viewers <b>wouldn't even let you search in highlights</b> within the file you're currently viewing. </span><aside class="sidenote">see PDF readers <a href="./annotating.html#pdfs">overview</a></aside></div></li>
<li>there is no easy way to quickly access all of your twitter favorites, people suggest using hacks like <a href="https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/131374/68104">autoscroll extension</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>searching data, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>search function often just isn't available at all, e.g. on Instapaper, you can't restrict search to highlights. If it is available, it's <b>almost never incremental</b>.</li>
<li>builtin browser search (<code class="inline">Ctrl-F</code>) sucks for the most part: it's not very easy to navigate as you don't get previews and you have to look through every match</li>
<li>sometimes you vaguely recall reading about something or seeing a link, but <b>don't remember where exactly</b>. Was it on stackoverflow? Or in some github issue? Or in a conversation with friend?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>data ownership and liberation, e.g.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
what happens if data disappears or service is down (temporary/permanently) or banned by your government?
</p>
<p>
You may think you live in a civilized country and that would never affect you. Well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387146/instapaper-gdpr-europe-access-shut-down-privacy-changes">in 2018</a>, Instapaper was unavailable in Europe for several months (!) due to missing the GDPR deadline.
</p></li>
<li><div><span class="before-aside">99% of services <b>don't have support for offline mode</b>. This may be just a small inconvenience if you're on a train or something, but there is more to it.
What if some sort of apocalypse happens and you lose all access to data? 
That depends on your paranoia level of course, and apocalypse is bad enough as it is, but my take on it is that at least I'd have my data :) </span><aside class="sidenote">see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#offline">#offline</a></aside></div></li>
<li>if you delete a book on Kobo, not only you can't access its annotations anymore, but they seem to get <b>wiped</b> from the database.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
So as you can see, my main frustrations are around the lack of the very basic things that computers can do <b>extremely</b> well: data retrieval and search.
</p>
<p>
I'll carry on, just listing some examples. Let's see if any of them resonate with you:

Things are listed are frustrating enough. There is another TODO : your data is <b>slipping away</b>.
</p>
<p>
TODO I feel especially strong about it as I consider part of me TODO extended mind?
</p>
<p>
Privacy concerns are important and it's understandable when people are pissed about services keeping hold of their data instead of properly deleting TODO examples?
</p>
<p>
However, often opposite is the case and you find that your data is gone or very hard to access:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Google Takout data, that is, all your browser activity, Youtube watch history, etc., are only kept by Google for <a href="./takeout-data-gone.html">few years</a></li>
<li>Chrome browser deletes history older than <a href="https://superuser.com/a/364475/300795">90 days</a></li>
<li>Firefox browser expires history based on some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Places_Expiration">magic algorithm</a></li>

</ul>
<p>
The problems above are sort of technical and in theory, can be solved by the companies that hold the data. There is another side to vanishing data:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>information is generally <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Archiving-URLs#link-rot">disappearing</a> from the Internet</li>
<li><p>

<p>
While people have right to delete their data from the Internet, arguably it doesn't extend to derived content or thoughts that you had on it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
I want all my problems and inconveniences magically solved, but I live in real world that's not gonna happen.
So let me be morespecific: I argue that one <b>major</b> obstacle is that people don't have easy (in both senses, TODO and while running programs) access to their data in the first place.
</p>
<p>
TODO Playing with data is fun. Getting it there isn't. (elaborate on it?)
</p>
<p>
So let's concentrate on 'easy access to data' part for now.
How would it look in ideal world?
</p>
<p>
My speculation on it, which I would be happy to hear your opinion on!
</p>
<p>
TODO arguably, easiest way to access data (as of today?) is when it's already on your filesystem.
TODO even easier when it's already in your interpreter in abstract form, but it's a bit too much.
</p>
<p>
Whether it's plaintext, sqlite or some sort of binary data – doesn't matter, already having it locally saves you from the whole class of problems (TODO link to later section).
</p>
<p>
So, ideally the online service you're using provides you with a client app that runs in background and continuously or at least regularly sucks in and synchronises your data to the latest state (ideally, identical to the one that backend uses).
It also provides client binding(s) in some reasonable programming language that represent all of this data.
Specific programming language doesn't matter, it's a trivial (almost automatic) task to map PODs from one language to another.
</p>
<p>
TODO list which problems it solves?
TODO FIXME actually summarise more specific problems I'm targeting, I only listed examples
</p>
<p>
Some caveats with these suggestions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
this particular suggestion might be harder to implement for <b>every user</b> than I thought.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, service developers would have more control on data access patterns, so in a way it might work better.
</p>
<p>
It would definitely be more effecient than other people writing cludgy tools to export and backup data.  
</p>
<p>
TODO better locality?
</p></li>
<li>'Normal' users often are not motivated enough</li>
<li><p>
Services have little motivation to promote this, as siloing and having monopoly on the client apps (e.g. web UI) keeps users on your platform even if you suck
</p>
<p>
TODO with the rise of distributed/federated services that would improve?
</p></li>
<li><p>
Ideally requires a VPS?
</p>
<p>
Although I don't see much problem running it on your personal computer if it's resilient enough.

Okay, so hopefully we can agree that the current situation isn't so great.
But I am a software enginner. And chances that if you're reading it, you're very likely a programmer as well. Surely we can deal with that, right?

<p>
TODO Your data is very hard to retrieve  
</p>
<p>
By 'liberating' in this context I mean retreiving your personal data to your local storage, hopefully in automated way.
</p>
<p>
On the first glance it doesn't look like a big deal. It's just data, right? Every programmer should be capable of extrating it, right?
</p>
<p>
This is until you realise you're probably using at least ten different online services and they all have different purposes, access patterns and TODO.
</p>
<p>
Even if you are willing to do it and you have the capacity (e.g. you are a programmer like me), it's still damn hard:
</p>
<p>
Let's assume an <b>optimistic</b> scenario, when the service has a public API. You're gonna have to deal with the following problems:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
authorisation
</p>
<p>
That's where it all starts with. TODO
</p>
<p>
TODO some services don't have it, and you don't have much choice but to keep your password in plaintext somewhere. (TODO example?)
</p></li>
<li><p>
documentation and discovery
</p>
<p>
If you want <b>all</b> your data, you have to look carefully though the whole documentation and make sure you've got it all covered.
</p>
<p>
If the service adds some new endpoints, you might never find that out.
</p></li>
<li><p>
rate limiting TODO link?
</p>
<p>
No one likes their API hammered, fair enough.
However, rate limiting often varies from API endpoint to endpoint and inherently tedious to get right.
</p></li>
<li><p>
pagination TODO link?
</p>
<p>
Just like rate limiting: not hard to implement in principle, on one off basis, tedious to do in some universal way because there is no common standard.
Pages might be retrieved as page numbers and counts on each page, offsets from start/end of data, before/after (ideal scenario), timestamps TODO
</p>
<p>
Content might change under your feet, and if the API developers or you are not careful, you might end up with missing data or even some logical corruption.
</p></li>
<li><p>
error handling
</p>
<p>
Authorisation, network, serializing, parsing, storing, synchronizing. 
There are among the most common error sources (as in, actual unrecoverable errors, not necessarily bugs) in software engineering generally and getting it right required for exporting your data.
TODO link to error handling post
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Now, some examples of more messed up scenarios:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
lack of API. Main issue with that is it becomes way harder to .
</p>
<p>
Missing API typically means that you need to do web scraping, which is orders of magnitude flakier, involves nasty parsing and generally fragile.
</p>
<p>
Some services might even actively prevent you from doing so by banning unusual user agents.
</p>
<p>
Potentially you're going to store your password somewhere which is way less secure than using a token.
</p>
<p>
Examples of such services:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>most (if not all?) of Facebook stuff: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Whatsapp</li>
<li>some APIs are incomplete. E.g. Pocket API doesn't give you away highlights unless you <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/pockexport#setting-up">mess with it</a></li>
<li>TODO private APIs (e.g. blinkist)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
app data on your phone: often kept
</p>
<p>
E.g. on android apps keep their data in <code class="inline">/data/data/</code> directory, by default which isn't accessible without root. 
</p>
<p>
Very few apps support automatic data exports, 
</p>
<p>
TODO e.g. temp. sensor as example? I had something else?
TODO e.g. headspace data
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
There are more difficulties:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>vendor lock TODO</li>
<li><p>
abstract representation
</p>
<p>
Having raw export data (e.g. sqlite database/json file/etc) is nice, but to actually use it you need an abstract representation.
</p>
<p>
You basically have to reinvent whatever the service developer does already. Again, many edge cases: unclear which data types to choose (nullable/non-nullable), 
which situations are invalid etc.
</p>
<p>
You need to figure out proper timestamps, whether it was UTC or not, parse it (I had to do it so often that I even memorized the wrong argument order in <code class="inline">datetime.strptime</code>)
</p></li>
<li><p>
lack of infrastructure
</p>
<p>
Some of us can afford keeping a VPS or TODO computer??
</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
Now, remember when I said it was tedious for programmers? Now think about ordinary people who have no clue what 'API' is.
They deserve to use their data too.

Shouldn't be too computationally demanding, e.g. push notifications basically already do that, but in a less effecient way.

Ideally, you'd be able to buy some sort of 'VPS' that acts as a hub for your personal data.

to be honest, the fact that it's fairly tedious to interact with your data is very sad, and ideally should be solved in some generic, API independent way, but I haven't had time to think much about it yet. Retrying and backoff, handling random API failures, etc.
