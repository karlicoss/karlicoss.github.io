<b>TLDR</b>: in this post, I'm going to be exploring <a class="link-down" href="#why">missed opportunities</a> at engaging and interacting with your personal data and digital trace,
and speculating on <a class="link-down" href="#exports_are_hard">why is it that way</a> and <a class="link-down" href="#data_mirror">how to make it easier</a>.
</p>
<p>
It might seem like a long rant, but I promise you I am not the kind of person who whines and vents just for the sake of it!
</p>
<p>
In this particular post, I'm just building up motivation and engaging you, and I <a class="link-down" href="#what_do_i_do">do have</a> some workarounds and suggestions.
This article got long enough, I also didn't want to mix discussions on motivation (this one) and my take on more technical details and implementation (which will <a class="link-down" href="#followups">follow</a>).

<h2 id="data_is_trapped"><a class="headerlink" href="#data_is_trapped">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Intro: your data is trapped</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-data_is_trapped">
<p>
Note: for clarity, I will use <b><span style="color:green">'service'</span> to refer to anything holding your data</b> and manipulating it, whether it's a website, phone app or a device (i.e. not necessarily something having an online presence).
</p>
<p>
On one hand, in 2019 things are pretty great. 
For almost anything you wish to do on your computer or phone, you can find several apps, platforms and ecosystems that will handle your task in one way or another.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, typically, once the service has your data it's <b>siloed and trapped</b>.
You are completely at the mercy of service's developers and management. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Within the same ecosystem (e.g. Google/Apple/Microsoft) you might get some integrations and interactions if the company spares them.
Apart from these, <b>integrations are virtually non-existent</b>.
</p>
<p>
We have so much data, yet it just sits there doing nothing.
</p>
<p>
Now and then <a href="https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self#applications-and-platforms">some startup</a> pops up that connects together couple of APIs for a fee.
I don't want to pick on startups but typically it's something trivial like displaying calories consumed from your food tracker app on the same plot as calories burnt from your fitness tracker.
Trivial is okay, and I do acknowledge it's way harder to implement than it looks (I even <a class="link-down" href="#exports_are_hard">explore why later</a>).
The sad reality is that as a user, you're lucky if you use the right kind of fitness tracker that the service supports, and you agree with their analysis methodology. Otherwise, sorry!
</p>
<p>
There are also services like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> which offer pretty primitive integrations and also require cooperation from all parties:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11378278">My Heroic and Lazy Stand Against IFTTT (Pinboard)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19458172">Google removing Gmail access from IFTTT</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Often UIs have inconveniences (or just plain suck). They are often fine for an average user (aka KPIs)
but leave a number of dissatisfied users, who are often the power users.
</p>
<p>
In essence, services fully control the way they present information to you.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it's a free market, just switch to another/better service, right? 
Switching to new and unfamiliar tools is cognitively hard enough as it is, but what's even worse is that in most cases you have to <b>leave behind</b> all your old data. 
You're lucky if you can do some sort of data import/export and if it works properly.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Personal data is in a sad state these days. Let me elaborate.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="why"><a class="headerlink" href="#why">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Why does it bother me?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why">
<style>.outline-4 h4              { font-weight: normal; } </style>
<style>.outline-4 .outline-text-4 { margin-left: 1em; color: #666; } </style>
<p>
To be fair, I don't understand how does it <b>not</b> bother you!
</p>
<p>
To start with, allow me to quote <a href="orger.html#intro">myself</a> here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I consume lots of digital content (books, articles, Reddit, Youtube, Twitter, etc.) and most of it I find somewhat useful and insightful.
I want to use that knowledge later, act and build on it. But there's an obstacle: the human brain.
</p>
<p>
It would be cool to be capable of always remembering and instantly recalling information you've interacted with, metadata and your thoughts on it.
Until we get augmented though, there are two options: the first is just to suck it up and live with it. You might have guessed this is not an option I'm comfortable with.
</p>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
The second option is compensating for your sloppy meaty memory and having information you've read at hand and a quick way of searching over it. 

</span><aside class="sidenote">see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#extendedmind">#extendedmind</a></aside></div>
<p>
<a id="motivation"></a>
That sounds simple enough but as with many simple things, in practice you run into obstacles. 
I'll give some I've personally been overcoming as examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>convenience of access, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to access highlights and notes on my Kobo ebook I need to actually <b>reach my reader and tap through e-ink</b> touch screen. Not much fun!</li>
<li><div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">if you want to search over annotations in your PDF collections… well good luck, I'm just not aware of such a tool. It's actually way worse: many PDF viewers <b>wouldn't even let you search in highlights</b> within the file you're currently viewing. </span><aside class="sidenote">see PDF readers <a href="./annotating.html#pdfs">overview</a></aside></div></li>
<li>there is no easy way to quickly access all of your twitter favorites, people suggest using hacks like <a href="https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/131374/68104">autoscroll extension</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>searching data, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>search function often just isn't available at all, e.g. on Instapaper, you can't restrict search to highlights. If it is available, it's <b>almost never incremental</b>.</li>
<li>builtin browser search (<code class="inline">Ctrl-F</code>) sucks for the most part: it's not very easy to navigate as you don't get previews and you have to look through every match</li>
<li>sometimes you vaguely recall reading about something or seeing a link, but <b>don't remember where exactly</b>. Was it on stackoverflow? Or in some github issue? Or in a conversation with friend?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>data ownership and liberation, e.g.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
what happens if data disappears or service is down (temporary/permanently) or banned by your government?
</p>
<p>
You may think you live in a civilized country and that would never affect you. Well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387146/instapaper-gdpr-europe-access-shut-down-privacy-changes">in 2018</a>, Instapaper was unavailable in Europe for several months (!) due to missing the GDPR deadline.
</p></li>
<li><div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">99% of services <b>don't have support for offline mode</b>. This may be just a small inconvenience if you're on a train or something, but there is more to it.
What if some sort of apocalypse happens and you lose all access to data? 
That depends on your paranoia level of course, and apocalypse is bad enough as it is, but my take on it is that at least I'd have my data :) </span><aside class="sidenote">see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#offline">#offline</a></aside></div></li>
<li>if you delete a book on Kobo, not only you can't access its annotations anymore, but they seem to get <b>wiped</b> from the database.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
As you can see, my main frustrations are around the lack of the very basic things that computers can do <b>extremely well</b>: data retrieval and search.
</p>
<p>
I'll carry on, just listing some examples. Let's see if any of them resonate with you:
</p>

<div class="outline-3">

</div>
<div class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0000001">Why can't I have incremental search over my tweets? Or browser bookmarks? Or over everything I've ever typed/read on the Internet?</h4>
</div>
<div class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0000002">Why can't I search across my watched youtube videos, even though most of them have subtitles hence allowing for full text search?</h4>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0000003">Why can't I see the places my friends recommended me on Google maps (or any other maps app)?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4">
<p>
It's just a matter of extracting links to maps from the chat apps and generating a list of coordinates. It's got to be trivial.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="org0000004">Why can't my Google Home add shopping list items to Google Keep? Let alone other todo-list apps.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Instead, it puts them in a completely separate product, <a href="https://shoppinglist.google.com">Shopping list</a>.
If any of these had an API, <b>any programmer</b> could write a script to synchronize them in a few hours.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0000005">Why can't I create a task in my todo list or calendar from a conversation on Facebook Messenger/Whatsapp/VK.com/Telegram?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Often, a friend recommends a book to you so you want it to add to your reading list. Or they ask you for something and you want to schedule a reminder.
</p>
<p>
Instead, these apps <b>actively prevent</b> me from using builtin Android share functions (because it means leaving the app presumably).

'Watch later' is fine for short videos that I can watch over dinner or on my commute.
Longer videos like talks and lectures need proper time commitment hence prioritizing.

I think all of this is pretty sad. Note that I haven't mentioned any mad science fiction stuff like tapping directly into the brain (as much as I wish it was possible).

Things I listed above are frustrating enough as they are.
There is another aspect to this: your data is <b>slipping away</b>.
</p>
<p>
Privacy concerns are important and it's understandable when people are pissed about services keeping hold of their data instead of properly wiping it.
</p>
<p>
However, oftentimes the opposite is the case and you find that your data is gone or very hard to access:

The problems above are sort of technical and in theory, can be solved by some engineering. There is another side to vanishing data:

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what_do_i_want">
<p>
I want all these inconveniences somehow solved, but I live in the real world and it's not gonna magically happen.
So let me be more specific: I argue that one <b>major</b> reason these tools and integration I want don't exist is that people don't have easy uniform access to their data in the first place.
</p>
<p>
"Easy" is used here in two senses:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b>easy for humans</b> to look at and browse through
</p>
<p>
This bit is hard in practice as (typically) the more machine friendly something is, the less human friendly it's.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>easy for programmers</b> to manipulate, analyze and interact with
</p>
<p>
Let's concentrate on this part for now. If this is solved, it automatically enables programmers to develop human-friendly tools.
In addition, playing with data and building tools on it feels fun as it is (unlike getting the data).
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
So how would 'easy access to data' look in an ideal world?
Let me present you my speculations on it, and I would be happy to hear your opinions on it!
</p>
<p>
I want <b>an API</b> that I can query and get any of my personal data.
Ideally, it wouldn't really matter where the data is and it could be a web API.
</p>
<p>
Realistically, as of today, the easiest way to quickly access your data and more importantly, play with it, is when it's <b>already on your filesystem</b>.
</p>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
Whether it's plaintext, sqlite or some sort of binary data – doesn't matter, already having it locally saves you from the whole class of problems (which I'm about to pinpoint in the following section).

</span><aside class="sidenote">even better if it's already in your RAM and interpreter, but that's a bit too much to wish for at this point.</aside></div>
<p>
As you've probably noticed, it's almost never the case that you have your personal data locally at hand. You need to spend extra effort to achieve this.

<p>
Hopefully we can agree that the current situation isn't so great.
But I am a software engineer. And chances that if you're reading it, you're very likely a programmer as well. Surely we can deal with that and implement, right?
</p>
<p>
Kind of, but it's <b>really hard</b> to retrieve data created by you.

<p>
At first glance it doesn't look like a big deal. It's just data, right? Every programmer should be capable of getting it from the API, right?
</p>
<p>
This is until you realize you're probably using at least ten different services, and they all have different purposes,
with various kinds of data, endpoints and restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Even if you have the capacity and are willing to do it, it's still damn hard.
</p>
<p>
You're gonna have to deal with the following problems:
</p>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="auth"><a class="headerlink" href="#auth">¶</a>authorization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-auth">
<p>
That's where it all starts with and it's a mess.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>easiest scenario: the service lets you generate an API token from its settings and you can just use it. Example: <a href="https://pinboard.in">pinboard</a></li>
<li><p>
typical scenario: you need to do the whole <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified">Oauth</a> thing. 
</p>
<p>
That involves creating a client app, getting client id, dealing with scopes and redirect urls, etc.
Pretty tedious, and you certainly can't expect a <b>nonprogrammer</b> to be able to follow these steps.
</p>
<p>
Examples: almost every service with an API out there: Twitter/Instapaper/Pocket/Github/etc.
</p></li>
<li><p>
worst case scenario: the service doesn't even offer a public API. That also has different grades of horrible:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
best worst: service uses a private API and you can spy on the token web app is using in browser dev tools.
</p>
<p>
Not too bad, but a bit dubious.
</p>
<p>
Example: Pocket API doesn't give you away highlights unless you <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/pockexport#setting-up">mess with it</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
typical worst: no private API, so you need to scrape the data. Sometimes you can grab the cookies from browser dev tools and use them to access your data.
</p>
<p>
Scraping is orders of magnitude flakier, involves nasty parsing and obviously fragile.
Some services might even actively prevent you from doing so by banning unusual user agents.
</p>
<p>
Examples: <a href="https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#sessions">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/blinkist-backup">Blinkist</a>
</p></li>
<li><p>
worst worst: you need to scrape the data and cookies don't work or expire often.
</p>
<p>
Basically means you need to use your username/password. Bonus points if there is 2-factor auth involved.
</p>
<p>
Potentially means you're going to store your password somewhere which is way less secure than using a token.
</p>
<p>
Example: <a href="https://takeout.google.com">Google Takeout</a> exports are not only asynchronous, but also don't have an API so you have to login in order to export.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
All the 'worst' scenarios are extremely flaky and basically impossible for nonprogrammers to use.

<p>
Whether you're using API or not, typically you'll have to retrieve multiple chunks of data and merge them after.
</p>
<p>
In principle, it's not hard to implement it on a one off basis, but unclear how to do it in some universal way because there is no common standard.
</p>
<p>
Pages might be addressed by page numbers and counts, offsets from start/end of data, before or after with respect to ids or timestamps, etc.
</p>
<p>
It's quite error prone: content might change under your feet, and if the API developers or you are not careful, you might end up with missing data or even some logical corruption.

No one likes their API hammered, fair enough.
However, rate limits often vary from API endpoint to endpoint and are inherently tedious to get right.

<ul class="org-ul">

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-data_mirror">
<p>
The way I see it, ideally the service you're using provides you with:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
a <b>data mirror</b> app
</p>
<p>
Best case scenario is if the service is <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">local-first</a> in the first place.
However, this may be a long way ahead and there are certain technical difficulties associated with such designs.
</p>
<p>
I'm suggesting a data mirror app which merely runs in background on the client side
and continuously/regularly sucks in and synchronizes backend data to the latest state.
</p>
<p>
Ideally this would be exactly the same state the backend uses, although in practice it would be hard from efficiency considerations
(e.g. it's faster for the backend to keep data in the same database instead of separate databases for each user).
</p>
<p>
It shouldn't be too resource demanding for the backend, e.g. data sync via push notifications basically already does that, but in an even less efficient way.
</p>
<p>
Data mirror app should dump data into an open machine-friendly format like json/sqlite database/etc.
</p>
<p>
This solves:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
authorization: however tedious it's to implement, can be handled by the service's developers.
</p>
<p>
They can make it as secure as necessary (e.g. 2FA/etc), and it's okay as long as you have to log onto it only once.
</p></li>
<li>pagination/consistency/rate limiting: non-problems, considering it's easier for the service's developers to correctly implement incremental data fetching</li>
<li>error handling: also the developers' responsibility. They would be better aware of which situations are programming bugs and which have to be handled carefully</li>
<li>documentation and discovery: hopefully developers are better suited to keep their internal representations and exports consistent (even incentivised as it allows for less code to be written)</li>
<li>backups: will still have to be done by external means, but the task is massively simplified: you just need to point your backup tool at your data storage</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
minimalistic <b>data bindings</b> in some reasonable programming language that represent all of this data.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, specific language doesn't matter, it's a simple task to map data from one programming language to another.
</p>
<p>
This solves:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>parsing: developers know better how to get it right; in addition the code can potentially be shared with the backend</li>
<li>abstract representation: would massively lower the barrier for integrating and interacting with data</li>
<li>offline: if you have all data locally you've got efficient access without latency and need for extra error handling</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
That's perhaps a naive and oversimplified view.
But to be honest, we're so far away from that that even some small steps towards would be quite a progress.
</p>
<p>
These suggestions would <b>decouple data from the UI</b> and let the community develop better tools for consuming and working with it.

this might be <b>hard to support</b> for everyone

On the other hand, service developers would have more control on data access patterns, so in a way it might work better.

<p>
It would definitely be more efficient than third parties writing kludgy tools to export and backup data.  
</p>
<p>
In addition, for some services and scenarios, it would give better data locality and lower latencies.

'average' users often are <b>not motivated enough</b> to demand such things

services have little motivation to promote this, <b>silos benefit them</b>
</p>
<p>
Having a monopoly on the client interface (e.g. web UI) keeps users on your platform even if you suck.
</p>
<p>
If anyone can implement a better interface, there would be little opportunity for stuff like ads, and the only way for the service to make money
would be to collect a fee for data collection and hosting. (which I personally would be happy to pay)
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Hopefully all of these issues would be solved by distributed/federated services, but we're pretty far from it.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
deleted content
</p>
<p>
E.g. imagine you liked someone's post on Facebook, it got mirrored locally, and then the author removed the post.
</p>
<p>
What's the right thing to do for the data mirror app?
Should it erase just the post you liked from your data mirror?
Should it keep the fact that you liked it at all?
</p>
<p>
You may disagree with the way such a policy is imposed by the service, hence implement additional logic to keep more data,
and at that point it seems like a matter for legal debate.
</p></li>
<li><p>
synchronizing data
</p>
<p>
If you want to access data from multiple devices, you either have to run multiple mirrors, which would be a bit of a hassle, or use some continuous sync service like Dropbox or <a href="https://syncthing.net">Syncthing</a>.
</p>
<p>
That however might not be so atomic, depending on the way data is kept on the disk, since files might be pulled in random or lexicographic order, depending on sync configuration.
</p></li>
<li><p>
protecting the data
</p>
<p>
Even if you don't trust your average startup at securing your data, it might be even less safe on average user's disk.
</p></li>
<li><p>
it's assumed that these tools/integrations are open source and running on computers you own.
</p>
<p>
Realistically, closed source tools do exist and it's understandable when people want money for their efforts.
</p>
<p>
From a user's perspective not everyone wants the hassle of running things locally either and many people are happy with online services for the most part.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what_do_i_do">
<p>
Of course, I'm not expecting someone to come and implement all of this for me.
I could start some sort of movement to demand it from services and platforms, but I hardly see myself as a good fit for that role.
</p>
<p>
Instead I've put effort into exporting, integrating and utilizing my data on my own according to the suggestions I formulated.
Putting this in writing helped me motivate and summarize many technical and infrastructural decisions.
</p>
<p>
I'll be describing my setup in more detail in future posts, however here are some bits and pieces:
</p>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="exports"><a class="headerlink" href="#exports">¶</a>regular data exports</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-exports">
<p>
This corresponds to the 'data mirror' bit.
</p>
<p>
I <a href="my-data.html">exported/scraped/reverse engineered</a> pretty much my entire digital trace and figured out automation and infrastructure which works for me.
</p>
<p>
I've shared <a href="https://github.com/search?type=Repositories&amp;q=user%3Akarlicoss+++topic%3Aexport">some</a> of my personal export scripts and tools.
</p>
<p>
I also have some helper scripts to keep individual exporter's code as clean as possible while ensuring exports are reliable.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned, I'll share all of this later in a separate post.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="mypkg"><a class="headerlink" href="#mypkg">¶</a>python package to access data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-mypkg">
<p>
Each data exporter comes with minimal bindings that merely map json/sqlite export into simple datatypes and data classes.
</p>
<p>
That way anyone who wishes to use data can kick off some reasonable representation, which is not overfitted to my specific needs.
</p>
<p>
Higher level querying and access, specific to myself is implemented in <a href="hpi.html#examples">my.</a> package (note that this post is still in draft stage).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/my"><code class="inline">my.</code></a> package allows me to query my data from anywhere, enabling me to use familiar data processing, analysis and visualization tools, and various integrations.
</p>
<p>
As a nice byproduct I've also finally figured out a reliable and elegant way to deal with <a href="mypy-error-handling.html">error handling in Python</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-how_it_is_used">
<p>
Finally, some tools and scripts I've implemented to make possible the interactions <a class="link-up" href="#why">that I want</a>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <a href="pkm-search.html">personal search engine</a> for quick incremental search of my data and digital trace</li>
<li><a href="orger.html">orger</a>: tool to convert data into org-mode views for instant and offline search and overview
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="orger-todos.html#reddit">also</a> for prioritizing content consumption (e.g. processing Reddit saves)</li>
<li><a href="orger-todos.html#krill">also</a> for populating my spaced repetition queue</li>
<li><a href="orger-todos.html#telegram2org">also</a> for creating TODOs straight from Telegram messages</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="./grasp.html">grasp</a>, browser extension to clip links straight into my org-mode notes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia">promnesia</a>, a browser extension to escape silos by unifying annotations and browsing history from different data sources (still somewhat WIP and needs final touches, but planning to release soon)</li>
<li>personal health, sleep and exercise dashboard, built from various data sources. I'm in the process of making it public, you can see some screenshots <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/cokt4f/what_do_you_all_do_with_your_data/ewmucgk">here</a></li>

Let me know if you can think of any other data integrations you are missing and perhaps we can think of something together!
