    <p>
I have a <a href="sad-infra.html">frustration</a> around the fact that our personal data is scattered, siloed and incredibly hard
to use for any purposes, not anticipated by the original developers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="my-data.html">One of my big efforts</a> is unifying all of this scattered data into a system that makes it easier
to oversee, combine, interact with and build <b>new tools</b> around it.
</p>
<p>
In this post I want to illustrate how to integrate a new data source in the system, with <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam Research</a> data as an example.
</p>
<p>
I've chosen Roam for this post because:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it's a cool, useful and rich data source</li>
<li>it hasn't been integrated before <a href="myinfra.html">in my system</a>, so it's easy to follow and document all the steps necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>
Throughout the post, I will link to my previous writing on building the <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#infra">#infra</a>, so I won't go into explaining every tiny detail and technical rationales here.
But if you have some questions, feel free to ask anyway!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what_is_roam">
<p>
<a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam</a> is a new note taking/thinking tool.
If you're an org-mode user, you can think of it as having a web app with a directory of org files with the main focus (as I see it) on:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>easy note capture</li>
<li>markup and <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-Links.html">internal links</a></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/ihYVODd74">bidirectional links</a>
</p>
<p>
This is pretty unique to Roam, and the nearest org-mode analogy is probably tags or <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Custom-Agenda-Views.html">custom agendas</a>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
You can learn more about Roam <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/1wnq-ZAAN">here</a>, which is a welcome page and a sandbox at the same time (very cool!).
</p>
<p>
If you want to get a glimpse of Org-mode <b>workflow</b> without having to use Emacs, Roam is probably <b>the</b> tool you should try.
</p>
<p>
So, let's say you've been using Roam and want to use its data outside of the web app, for some other purpose. What do you do?
</p>
<p>
For this demo, I'll be using a <b>public</b> <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/covid19/graph">covid19 Roam database</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="export"><a class="headerlink" href="#export">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Export raw data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-export">
<p>
The first step is figuring out how to get the raw data.
</p>
<p>
Roam doesn't have a public API yet, but they let you export a JSON from the web interface, which is good enough for us.
How to proceed with this knowledge? I apply the principles from <a href="exports.html#export_layer">"Building data liberation infrastructure"</a>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
use an existing library to fetch the data
</p>
<p>
It is <b>counterproductive</b> to reimplement this all over again.
Luckily, there is one, <a href="https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git">MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git</a>! It's very decent and does all the heavy lifting like browser automation.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I had to do is implementing a <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/exports/blob/master/roamresearch.py">wrapper</a> to call it and extract the JSON from the archive.
</p></li>
<li><p>
keep the raw data intact
</p>
<p>
I simply store the <b>JSON without any changes</b> on my filesystem.
There is not much point trying to squeeze inherently hierarchical Roam data into a database.
If performance ever becomes an issue, a transparent <a href="unnecessary-db.html#cachew">caching layer</a> can always be added.
</p>
<p>
Roam is under active development, so it's likely that the export format will change.
It would be pretty sad if it breaks exports, and keeping the data unchanged means I always have a recent version on my disk.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="automate"><a class="headerlink" href="#automate">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Automate export</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-automate">
<p>
Ok, now we can get a snapshot of Roam data with a single script run: <code class="inline">./roamresearch.py &gt; export.json</code>. What's next?
</p>
<p>
The idea is that we run it <b>periodically</b>, for example, few times a day. It does mean that the data on your disk is lagging behind slightly, but that gives you 90% of the benefits without all the downsides of
implementing a realtime synchronization. You also need an API for two-way synchronization anyway (unless you want to poll the service like crazy).
</p>
<p>
Running it manually is not much fun, and there are several tools that can aid us in it.
I've done an overview in <a href="scheduler.html">this post</a>, and personally, I'm using an experimental tool, <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/dron">dron</a>, which is basically a nice Systemd frontend.
But it really doesn't matter what exactly to use, so the simplest is a good old <b>cron job</b>:
</p>
<pre class="example">00 05 * * * /soft/export-scripts/roamresearch.py &gt; /exports/roamresearch/data.json
</pre>
<p>
This will export your data every day at 5:00 and save it to a JSON file. The file will be used by other tools and scripts to get <b>the most recent snapshot</b> of the data.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
For me the command looks a bit more sophisticated:
</p>
<pre class="example">/soft/arctee/arctee.py /exports/roamresearch/roamresearch_{utcnow}.json -- /soft/export-scripts/roamresearch.py
</pre>
<p>
This keeps every export along with a timestamp, ensures atomic writing to minimize concurrency issues and retries automatically.
I elaborate more on it <a href="exports.html#arctee">here</a>, but it's not super crucial for Roam, more of a nice-to-have thing.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you automate JSON exports, you also get Roam <b>data backups for free</b> (you back up your disk, right?).
</p>
<p>
There is a problem though. Working with JSON is okay for a one-off thing, but if you want to truly benefit from using the data for different applications, you better off having some abstract interface
for it.
While Roam's JSON export is fairly reasonable (unlike many other services), it's pretty annoying to figure out the schema
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git-demo/blob/27e5fdace2de47dd810caa10e7fb366a8c661a57/json/roam-to-git-demo.json#L123-L143">raw data</a>. It's clear, that you'll need
(at least) to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>convert integer timestamps into datetime objects</li>
<li>keep track of optional and required fields</li>
<li>deconstruct the hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is annoying, boring and error-prone to do all over again.
We need some central way to encapsulate and adapt raw JSON data for easier programmatic use.
Say hello to the <a href="exports.html#dal">data access layer</a>!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="dal"><a class="headerlink" href="#dal">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Adapt the data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-dal">
<p>
The data access layer is responsible for deserializing and converting raw (i.e. JSON/sqlite) format into abstract objects, easy to work in your code.
</p>
<p>
Normally I'd try to use existing data bindings, but Roam is pretty new and I haven't found any, so I implemented my own.
The data adapter is integrated into <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">HPI</a> package, which is a central entry point for all of my data access.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is contained within a single <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/pull/26/files">pull request</a> and takes about 100 LOC.
</p>
<p>
If you browse through the code you can also see the importance of raw data encapsulation: for example,
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/96a850faf94c781be2fdc24f01699cba9edf580e/my/roamresearch.py#L36-L54"><code class="inline">created</code></a> or
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/96a850faf94c781be2fdc24f01699cba9edf580e/my/roamresearch.py#L75-L82"><code class="inline">permalink</code></a> properties.
You really don't want to reimplement this all over again.
</p>
<p>
To link HPI package with your private data, you add a small section to your private config in <samp class="inline">~/.config/my/my/config/__init__.py</samp>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span class="org-keyword">class</span> <span class="org-type">roamresearch</span>:
    <span class="org-variable-name">export_path</span> = <span class="org-string">'/exports/roamresearch/'</span>
    <span class="org-variable-name">username</span> = <span class="org-string">'covid19'</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
After this, you get IDE help when working with Roam data. For example, <samp class="inline">mypy</samp> will remind me that <samp class="inline">title</samp> is optional, so I won't have <samp class="inline">None</samp> related issues.
</p>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="interactive"><a class="headerlink" href="#interactive">¶</a>Interactive queries</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-interactive">
<p>
At this stage, you can play with the data <b>interactively</b> in your Python interpreter. For example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
"what's the most active note in my database?"
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span class="org-keyword">import</span> my.roamresearch <span class="org-keyword">as</span> RR
<span class="org-variable-name">roam</span> = RR.roam()
<span class="org-variable-name">note</span> = <span class="org-builtin">max</span>(roam.notes, key=<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> n: <span class="org-builtin">len</span>(n.children))
<span class="org-keyword">print</span>(note)
</pre>
</div>
<pre class="example">Node(created=2020-02-27 02:29:22.725000+00:00, title=Worst-Case Scenario Planning, body=None)
</pre></li>
<li><p>
"what's the most 'dangling' link in my database"
</p>
<p>
This could be useful to organize it, and fill frequently occurring references with more context.
</p>
<p>
The code is very straightforward:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span class="org-keyword">import</span> my.roamresearch <span class="org-keyword">as</span> RR
<span class="org-variable-name">roam</span> = RR.roam()

<p>
This is cool because you don't have to wait till developers add new features or come up with a query language (which is also really hard!).
You can use a powerful programming language you already know.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orger">
<p>
Now that accessing the data is a matter of <code class="inline">import my.roamresearch</code>, we can enjoy using it!
</p>
<p>
One very useful tool for interacting with my data is <a href="orger.html">Orger</a>.
Orger is a library that helps you generate an org-mode representation of your data.
</p>
<p>
I won't go into the Orger module implementation details – you can check out the code here: <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger/blob/master/modules/roamresearch.py"><code class="inline">roamresearch.py</code></a>.
There are also <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger/blob/master/modules">more</a> modules for other services like Twitter, Reddit, Instapaper, etc.
</p>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
We will use Orger to generate a <b>read-only</b> mirror of the Roam <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/covid19/graph">database</a>.
The idea is that you run Orger script periodically to get a reasonably up-to-date representation of your Roam data.
You'll still use Roam web app to modify your notes.

</span><aside class="sidenote">note, this makes it different from what <a href="https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam">org-roam</a> offers</aside></div>
<p>
Of course, it would be cool to have proper bidirectional sync, so your modifications to the org-mode file are reflected in Roam.
But it's a <b>much</b> harder problem, especially without an API.
</p>
<p>
But even having a read-only replica enables you to do lots of cool things!
I invite you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib_PDJpTh-Q">watch a short <b>demo</b></a> I recorded, and I'll highlight some features here in writing.
</p>
<p>
You benefit from <b>the existing infrastructure and tooling</b> around org-mode:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
the org-mode markup and text editor integration
</p>
<p>
Roam markup maps naturally into org-mode (perhaps not very surprising).
</p>
<p>
So you can use outlines/colors/bold/italic/linka/code blocks/whatnot. As a bonus, you get all the associated Emacs customizations.
</p></li>
<li><p>
the Emacs navigation features
</p>
<p>
You can use your favorite keybindings <b>with no need to learn new hotkeys</b> hardcoded by the developers. For example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>editor specific: with <samp class="inline">evil-mode</samp> you can just use Vim navigation (<code class="inline">hjkl</code> , <code class="inline">$</code> / <code class="inline">w</code> / <code class="inline">b</code> / etc.)</li>
<li><p>
org-mode specific: folding/unfolding (<code class="inline">Shift+Tab/Tab</code>), outline navigation (<code class="inline">{</code> , <code class="inline">}</code>), jumping to the heading (<code class="inline">gh</code>)
</p>
<p>
Again, if you're an <samp class="inline">evil</samp> person, just check out <a href="https://github.com/Somelauw/evil-org-mode/blob/master/doc/keythemes.org"><samp class="inline">evil-org-mode</samp></a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Link navigation: you can use <a href="https://github.com/noctuid/link-hint.el#readme">link-hint</a> to quickly navigate links with your keyboard (<code class="inline">SPC s l</code> in Doom Emacs)
</p>
<p>
This is similar to web browser extensions like vimperator,
<a href="https://www.pakstech.com/blog/browse-web-with-keyboard/#tridactyl">Tridactyl</a> and
<a href="https://www.pakstech.com/blog/browse-web-with-keyboard/#surfingkeys">Surfingkeys</a>.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Navigating in your text editor is very fast and you never experience network latency or backend hiccups.
</p></li>
<li>if you need to edit the notes, you can jump back into the Roam web interface by following the permalink</li>
<li><code class="inline">[[Internal Links]]</code> in Roam also have first-class support in org-mode, so you can jump within the file</li>
<li><p>
the Emacs search modules
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>regular plaintext search (<code class="inline">/</code> if you're a Vim person)</li>
<li><p>
<samp class="inline">helm-swoop</samp>: shows you the search results <b>and</b>  the context in which each result occurred.
</p>
<p>
It's probably easier if you check out the <a href="https://github.com/emacsorphanage/helm-swoop#readme">demo gif</a> than to put it in words.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<samp class="inline">helm-ripgrep</samp>: I'm using it for a global incremental search (a <a href="pkm-search.html#snippet_other">single keybinding</a> away) over <a href="pkm-search.html#other"><b>all</b></a> of my personal data.
</p>
<p>
And if you're still not using <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, you should seriously give it a try.
</p></li>

<p>
<b>Typically</b>, web apps provide a pretty <a href="sad-infra.html#why_search">pathetic</a> search experience.
Sometimes it's just not unavailable.
When it is, it's slow, the results are paginated, ranked by some magic algorithm and the scope is often restricted
for performance reasons.
Roam actually stands out because unlike most, it <b>does have</b> an incremental search within the notes.
</p>
<p>
Searching in Emacs is an incredibly pleasant experience.
The search is incremental, updates results as fast as you type, and you can configure it as you wish.
</p>
<p>
Warning: once you get used to a fast incremental search in Emacs, you will struggle to go back.
You'll end up grumpy and as frustrated about web apps as me. Think twice.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
And some extra things I haven't mentioned in the video:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
you get (read-only) offline mode for free
</p>
<p>
Roam does offer offline mode in the browser, but however talented Roam engineers are, a plain text file will always be more reliable.
</p>
<p>
Fun fact: during the first attempt to record the demo, Roam web app wasn't loading :P
</p></li>
<li><p>
you get mobile access
</p>
<p>
Roam doesn't have first-class mobile support yet, so with an org-mode mirror, you can benefit from the existing org-mode apps for your phone.
</p>
<p>
Again, Roam specifically might implement it in the future, but the point is that you can be <b>ahead of the developers</b> and do it yourself.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="why_roam"><a class="headerlink" href="#why_roam">¶</a>if org-mode is so cool why not just use it <b>instead</b> of Roam?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why_roam">
<p>
Better ask someone who actively uses Roam, because I'm a stubborn org-mode user!
If you're like me, you probably tend to stay away from web apps.
</p>
<p>
In that case, perhaps, check out <a href="https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam">jethrokuan/org-roam</a>, which implements a workflow similar to Roam, but within Emacs.
</p>
<p>
But even I can come up with some objective (I hope) reasons to avoid Emacs:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
entry barrier
</p>
<p>
I won't lie, I spent a while grasping and learning Emacs and I <b>still</b> struggle at times.
</p>
<p>
But also, most of the frustrations are when I'm trying to implement things that wouldn't even be possible in other apps and editors without
modifying their source code or self-hosting.
With a reasonable config, like <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">doom emacs</a>, you can get very far just on the defaults.
</p></li>
<li><p>
cloud sync
</p>
<p>
As with all cloud apps, this a curse and a blessing at the same time.
</p>
<p>
The "blessing" bit will be especially evident if Roam adds real-time collaboration (and I bet it's <b>more "when" than "if"</b>).
</p>
<p>
I have to admit, to my knowledge, org-mode gang doesn't have much to offer here.
<span style="color:darkorange"><strong>I think this is a very important problem and needs solving.</strong></span>
</p></li>
<li><p>
easier integration with web
</p>
<p>
For example, you can embed tweets in Roam, and there is lots of potential for dynamic features.
<span style="color:darkorange"><strong>A browser frontend for Emacs might actually be a good idea.</strong></span>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Org-mode mirror can <b>complement</b> your Roam database and serve as an <b>additional</b> interface and a means of learning org-mode,
without having to fully succumb to it.

<h2 id="promnesia"><a class="headerlink" href="#promnesia">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Promnesia: integrate Roam with your browser</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-promnesia">
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia">Promnesia</a> is an extension for enhancing your browser history.
It unifies the browsing history, which is siloed in various apps and services; and lets you explore the history in context, showing the information on where and how you've encountered the links.
If you want to learn more about it, check out <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#demos">demos</a>, here I'll only concentrate on demonstrating Roam.
</p>
<p>
To use Roam data in Promnesia, all you need is to add a small bit to the <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/blob/master/config.py.example">config</a>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span class="org-keyword">from</span> promnesia.sources <span class="org-keyword">import</span> roamresearch
<span class="org-variable-name">SOURCES</span> = [
   ...,
   Source(roamresearch.index, name=<span class="org-string">'roam'</span>),
   ...,
]
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And that's it! This enables Roam Research module <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/blob/master/src/promnesia/sources/roamresearch.py">(40 lines of code)</a>, which consumes the data from <a class="link-up" href="#dal">HPI</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can also index others' public Roam databases. If Roam is a second brain, this can be a way of <b>interfacing with others' second brains</b>!
</p>
<p>
I've <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyJI96AH91o">recorded a demo</a>, showing various workflows for your Roam data, which are enabled by Promnesia.
</p>
<p>
Here's a text summary of the features, demonstrated in the video:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
the sidebar
</p>
<p>
Shows your browsing history for the <b>current page</b> along with the source, timestamp, and the <b>context</b>, in which the link occurred.
</p>
<p>
Clicking on the permalink brings us straight to the outline within the Roam Research web app.
</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
what are the <b>github repositories</b> saved in this Roam database?
</p>
<p>
If you open the sidebar on <samp class="inline">github.com</samp>, you can see the subpages along with the contexts, in particular,
links to all the github repositories saved in Roam.
</p></li>
<li><p>
what are the <b>tweets</b> saved in this Roam database
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if you open <samp class="inline">twitter.com</samp>, you can see all the tweets in your browsing history.
If you open a specific Twitter profile, you get to see all the tweets from a specific person.
</p>
<p>
I find it extremely useful to recall when you've engaged with the content from a specific person,
for example, to figure out whether you should follow them.
</p></li>
<li><b>full text search</b> over your browsing history</li>
<li><p>
<b>how did I get on this page</b>?
</p>
<p>
You can trace through all of your history to remember why you bookmarked a page.
</p></li>
<li><p>
what links on this page have I already visited?
</p>
<p>
When you press 'mark visited', Promnesia highlights the links you've already visited so you can explore new information more efficiently.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
There is some room for improvement, especially in terms of the UI (e.g. markup handling could be better), but these are easy to fix.
</p>
<p>
These workflows aren't unique to Roam, and possible with many other data sources.
Promnesia already supports <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/tree/master/src/promnesia/sources">many</a>, and adding new is very easy.
You can find find more links, screenshots, and demos in the <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#demos">repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for watching, check it out, and let me know if you can think of other cool features!
