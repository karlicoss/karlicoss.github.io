    <div class="summary">How I visited a contemporary art museum and didn't get it</h2>
    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p>
Today I visited <a href="https://www.ludwigmuseum.hu/en">Ludwig Museum</a> in Budapest, which hosts a contemporary art gallery.
</p>
<p>
I don't think I generally 'get' contemporary art. However I don't get conventional either! I'm quite an unsophisticated person, some of art I like and appretiate, some don't. So I'm usually trying to expose myself to it just to keep up.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, by the time I got to the third floor of the exhibition I started to get irritated. Usually, I can appreciate at least some of art objects, but none of the ones I had seen so far made any sense. 
</p>
<p>
Some irritation was directed internally: "Ugh why am I doing this to myself, I should have gotten a coffee, sat on grass and enjoyed reading Penrose instead". But also a bit at the artists: "Ok, it's 2019, hasn't humanity seen enough white squares and various kinds of gradients?".
</p>
<p>
So as I walked among popart on the last floor my mind wandered and I remembered a post I read on <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/26/rule-genius-in-not-out/">SSC</a>. The idea that I had absorbed from it is that I shouldn't really judge people who are trying to come up with new ideas and things; they are already a minority and it's not worth wasting my mental resources as long as they are not harming anyone.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it's similar with art? They are exploring new territory, new mediums, so they are quite likely to make mistakes, such as things very few people get, if not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shard">hated by many</a>.
But the 1% that does manage to push the boundary would result in something beautiful that no one else would otherwise make (I'm sure you fancy at least some contemporary <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/2014-archdaily-building-of-the-year-awards_n_4645591">buildings</a> or <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern">art works</a> unless you were born in 1830). 
</p>
<p>
Not sure what happens to the remaining 99%. Maybe they give up on trying to invent new art and just become decent designers/architects? Would be interesting to check if that's actually the case.
</p>
<p>
This realization made the irritation go and made the rest of exploration a bit more pleasurable.
