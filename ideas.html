Basically, continuous (e.g. inotify-backed), open source and always available file sync.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dropbox is continuous, but proprietary. It's not distributed, but central server tends to be very available.</li>
<li>Syncthing is continuous and open source, but only syncs among your own devices. If all of them are off, you wouldn't be able to access your files.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ideally, it would be something based on Bittorrent, and the chunks of data would be distributed among participants with sufficient redundancy.
So most of the time you would rely on your own devices like in Syncthing, but in case of device loss or temporary outage you'd be able to assemble the data from redundant chunks in the peer network.
Not sure how much redundant it has to be and if that approach works in practice.

<p>
You chat with someone and discuss something. Because conventional IM software imposes timestamp ordering, it often ends up interleaved with some ongoing things (e.g. "by the way remember about that thing tomorrow"),
and you distract or switch. The discussion gets forgotten and/or the context is lost.
</p>

<p>
It's way worse in bigger Slack or Telegram channels (e.g. 15+ people). Sometimes you (well, at least I do) wait to post a message because you don't feel like interrupting some ongoing discussion and you don't want your message to be buried either. 
So you have to keep it somewhere and make a reminder or something, which is cognitive overhead. Because of the overall volume of messages people tend to mute group conversations, and then miss actually useful stuff.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, in a certain group chat/channel you should be able to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>fork conversation off an arbitrary message, so you'd have a tree.</li>
<li>view all the ongoing conversations/threads. Mute, mark as high priority, etc.</li>
<li>perhaps archive the ones that are not relevant anymore.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currently existing things I know of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Google wave?</li>
<li>Telegram got replies which work in very few specific cases and not very sustainable for a proper conversation.</li>
<li><p>
Slack got threads, which sort of solve this issue.
</p>

<p>
You can't turn old conversations into threads, but if you notice an opportunity early, or make a habit of spinning off early, you can work with it. It's not really used for personal conversations thought.
</p></li>

<li>XMPP is dead I guess, so not sure how easy it would be to prototype that.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Interesting enough, meatspace conversations also have this curse of linear order let alone other aspects that make them hard! But that's a whole different problem.

Something that understands the syntax of programming language and operates on top of that. So for instance, reordering methods in a class would be trivial operation and not show up in diff.
There are some caveats though: e.g. in some dynamic languages order of definition might matter, so you still want it to be backed by plaintext, probably.
Perhaps it has to be a diff filter rather than full scale VCS.

Where physics is described by some sort of Lagrangian, and the evaluation semantics would would be consistent with its dynamics. 
Wonder if that's possible without involving explicit computations via dependent types.
I guess would also correspond to some sort of special logic.
Also making sure the set of correct programs is <b>exactly</b> the set of feasible states is presumably way harder.

In the simplest approximation take some simple conical/cylindrical filter, water flow/temperature dependency and coarseness.
As an output we get expected amount of caffeine, oils, some estimate of bitterness and acidity etc.

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2019-04-22 Mon 21:28] </span></span> I ran into <a href="https://prima-coffee.com/learn/article/brewing-guides/comparing-kalita-wave-recipes/33005">this guide</a> and surely coffee brewing doesn't have to be so elaborate!
</p>

<p>
I mean, seriously:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Pulse pour by adding 65g of water in 15 seconds, followed by a waiting period of 15 seconds and repeat 5 more times (pouring timeline below) . Each pour should begin in the center, work its way outward, and then return back to the center.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What the fuck is that?? There is no way coffee taste depends on such intricate patterns of pouring water.
A mathematical model would cast away this bro science at least to some extent.
</p>

<p>
I also can't really understand how is one capable of estimating coffee on the scale from 0 to 10, but perhaps that's just my unsophisticated taste buds, and I accept other people can train themselves to do that.
