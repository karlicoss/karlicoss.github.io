TLDR: when I read I try to read <a href="https://help.open.ac.uk/active-reading">actively</a>, which for me mainly involves using various tools to annotate content: highlight and leave notes as I read. I've programmed <a class="link-down" href="#infra">data providers</a> that parse them and provide nice interface to interact with this data from other tools. My <a class="link-down" href="#org0000000">automated scripts</a> use them to render these annotations in human readable and searchable plaintext and generate <a class="link-down" href="#todos">TODOs</a>/<a class="link-down" href="#spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> items.
</p>
<p>
In this post I'm gonna elaborate on all of that and give some motivation, review of these tools (mainly with the focus on open source thus extendable software) and my vision on how they could work in an ideal world.
I won't try to convince you that my method of reading and interacting with information is superior for you: it doesn't have to be, and there are people out there more eloquent than me who do that. I assume you want this too and wondering about the practical details.

At some point in my life I realized I didn't remember most of the books/papers/posts/videos I had consumed few years before. 
</span><aside class="sidenote sidenote">For brevity I'll just refer to all of this as 'content' further on</aside></div>
<p>
That bothered me increasingly until I bought a Kindle which had 'highlight' functionality and virtual keyboard; and I had discovered it to help a lot with recalling.
</p>
<p>
I've become increasingly obsessed with this and these days ability to highlight when I read serves multiple purposes for me:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the very act of spending conscious effort on highlighting and commenting helps to remember better.</li>
<li><p>
it's easier to recall the content I already read, I just skim through highlights and refresh the memory
</p>
<p>
In particular, often I'd run on something on the internet that I remember reading before. If I have annotations for that, I can quickly go through them and restore the context.
</p></li>
<li>it's easier to recommend content to other people because you can refer to specific moments or points you liked/disliked</li>
<li>it's got social value if highlights are visible to other people (e.g. <a class="link-down" href="#hypothesis">Hypothesis</a>, Medium, Goodreads)</li>
<li>it helps with <a href="./notes.html#book_scoring">book scoring</a>. If I don't have any highlights, it probably means that the content was not interesting at all for me. Fiction books are not an exception: I tend to highlight use of language I liked, inspirational things, etc.</li>
<li>it serves as activity log if you are into <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#lifelogging">#lifelogging</a>.</li>
<li>you can <a class="link-down" href="#todos">populate your TODO list</a> and <a class="link-down" href="#spaced_repetition">step up your spaced repetition game</a>.</li>

<p>
I'm going to review some of the tools I tried using and still using and highlight their different positive and negative aspects. If you're getting impatient, you can skip straight to my <a class="link-down" href="#comparison">comparison table</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000002">
<p>
I won't really write much about it for one reason which is a big deal: while you can highlight text, you can't leave notes. Nearest functionality is 'recommending' a highlight while reading a comment, but that's only displayed on your 'timeline'.
</p>
<p>
Pocket API doesn't support exporting highlights too, or to be precise it seems to be hidden. If you need it you can use <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/pockexport">my script</a> where I hacked around it.
</p>
<p>
Also, interesting enough, <a class="link-down" href="#kobo">Kobo reader</a> has got Pocket integration, but for some reason when you read Pocket articles on Kobo, you can't highlight at all (let alone syncing highlights with Pocket). Not sure what's the purpose of this integration.
</p>
<p>
Pocket was acquired by Mozilla in 2017, which might be a good thing, but so far their main focus seem to be readability features.
</p>
<p>
You can also read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19763106">a rant</a> raising similar issues to what I mentioned.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-instapaper">
<p>
I won't go into Instapaper's readability capabilities (e.g. fonts and article formatting) because it's not something I care much about, so you might be better off googling that for yourself, here I'll concentrate on annotating aspect. 
Here are couple of recent extensive comparisons of Instapaper and Pocket, which feature screenshots and other aspects of Instapaper:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/instapaper-vs-pocket">Read-It-Later App Showdown: Instapaper vs. Pocket</a>; <a href="https://zappy.zapier.com/A040E0D5-C672-4F08-812B-D7793F6B40A7.png">screenshot</a> of annotation interface.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@janniks/instapaper-vs-pocket-2019-comparison-453524ff952d">Instapaper vs. Pocket (2019 Comparison)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
So, to read something in Instapaper, first you'll have to import the article into it (to unclutter and optimize it for reading). 
Due to this import process, you can <b><b>only read and highlight in Instapaper's app</b></b>, and you can only see your highlights there as well, which is its main limitation for me.
</p>
<p>
The only reason I'm using it at all is that its Android app has got <b><b>offline</b></b> capabilities, so I would export to Instapaper things I want to read on the tube while I don't have connection and read/comment while offline.
</p>
<p>
Mind that free version of Instapaper has got <b><b>5 notes per month limit</b></b>. Personally I'm happy to pay 3$ per month for <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/premium">premium version</a> of such a decent product though in absence of good alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Instapaper got <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/api">Json API</a>, through which you can access your saved articles, comments and highlights. I'm using a <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/instapaper">fork</a> of python wrapper to access it. Highlights are only stored as text though (as opposed to CSS/xpath locators), so there is no easy way to match them against original text apart from some sort of fuzzy search. 
</p>
<p>
<a id="org0000003"></a>Search function works for full text search in saved articles, but doesn't let you restrict search for highlights, and you can't search in notes at all.
</p>
<p>
One red flag was in 2018 when Instapaper wasn't available in Europe for few months until they resolved GDPR issues. While I don't blame it on Instapaper, this is a kind of thing that happens when you don't own your data and use a closed source product.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-wallabag">
<p>
Wallabag is the most mature open source/selfhosted read-it-later kind of project I know of. <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/7/wallabag">Here's</a> a review featuring some screenshots of their web app and Android app.
</p>
<p>
It's very similar to Instapaper in terms of <b><b>having to import</b></b> the article in Wallabag in order to annotate it. I used it for a while and only had some issues with importing articles heavy on MathJax backed Latex.
</p>
<p>
If you don't want to selfhost it, you can use <a href="https://www.wallabag.it/en">wallabag.it</a> hosting for as little as 9 euros per year and two weeks of trial.
</p>
<p>
<a id="org0000005"></a>There is also an <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/android-app">Android app</a>, but sadly it <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/android-app/issues/115">lacks</a> support for highlighting.
</p>
<p>
I wish it had more attention from the community, and might try to work on Android annotation when I got more time.

<h3 id="hypothesis"><a class="headerlink" href="#hypothesis">¶</a><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/#see-how-it-works">Hypothes.is</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-hypothesis">
<p>
Hypothesis is simply awesome and my favorite web annotation tool. Their killer feature is that it embeds a bit of JS in the page to provide an <b><b>in-browser overlay</b></b>, so you don't have to leave the page you were reading and can highlight and add comments natively.
They use something cool called <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/fuzzy-anchoring">fuzzy anchoring</a> to achieve this.
That also makes annotations <b><b>resilient to document markup changes</b></b>, and if they can't locate your annotations it would be still shown in metadata as <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/showing-orphaned-annotations">'orphaned'</a>, so you never lose your notes.
</p>
<p>
Another cool feature is that you can choose to make your annotations public and see other people's annotations or create a private group if you want to share them among specific people only.
</p>
<p>
To get a sense of it you can skim through <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotation-basics">tutorial</a> which has plenty of screenshots,
and I also strongly recommend you checking it out in action here: <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard">Annotation Is Now a Web Standard</a>,
or try the very page <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://beepb00p.xyz/annotating.html#hypothesis">you're reading now</a>.
</p>
<p>
You don't have to install anything or register, it's just a widget embedded in the page, but do make sure to allow JS.
You should see yellow highlights and the sidebar on the right.
</p>
<p>
It's open source, can be selfhosted and they provide their own service for free (but please consider donating them!).
</p>
<p>
Since Hypothesis powered by javascript, it actually works well in modern <b><b>Android</b></b> browsers via <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/start/">bookmarklet</a>.
It's somewhat not obvious in terms of browser UI how to actually use them though:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for mobile Firefox, once you added a bookmarklet, to invoke it you need to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/3uquy5/do_bookmarklets_work_in_firefox_browser_for/cxh8uvq">tap on the address bar</a> and click the bookmarklet.</li>
<li>for mobile Chrome, it's a bit more tedious but also <a href="https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/159308/how-can-a-bookmarklet-be-added-on-mobile-chrome">possible</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
One downside of this service is that you won't be able to annotate while offline.
I feel it's actually more of mobile browser's problem in general rather than Hypothesis though.
While you potentially can annotate offline without querying API and preserving data in <samp class="inline">localStorage</samp>, if you can't load the page in the first place, it doesn't matter. Perhaps that can be given better support in browsers.
</p>
<p>
Hypothesis got <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/v1/#tag/annotations/paths/~1search/get">JSON API</a> which gives access to your and other people's public annotations.
I'm using <a href="https://github.com/judell/Hypothesis">judell/Hypothesis</a> python wrapper to access and back up this data.

<p>
Shameless plug! If you just want to send annotations directly into a plaintext (e.g. org-mode) file and don't really care about displaying them within the original web page you can use my <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/grasp">grasp</a> browser addon for that.
</p>
<p>
I typically use it for highlights that would be good candidates for TODO items, e.g. something actionable like piece of advice or further reading.
</p>
<p>
Not available for <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/grasp/issues/15">mobile yet</a>, but perhaps on Android native select and share capabilities (e.g. into <a href="https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android">orgzly</a>) makes more sense anyway.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-pdfs">
<p>
Small disclaimer: I don't own Mac/Windows/iPhone so have very little idea what's going on in their world. Sorry! You can take a look at a section I added with <a class="link-down" href="#other_tools">other people's suggestions</a>.
</p>
<p>
PDF format is a complicated beast, and its native annotations are a whole different story to annotating web.
</p>
<p>
First, its ISO standard is <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63534.html">not freely available</a>. Adobe website has got some sort of <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html">reference</a>
which is not the same as standard, but apparently close enough.
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few different kinds of PDF annotations, e.g. you can see them here in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/PDF32000_2008.pdf">section 12.5.6: Annotation Types</a> or in <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/blob/a4d3db87c3bae5e2a364c828479a6cbb0277069e/poppler/Annot.h#L606-634">Poppler source code</a>.
In addition to Highlight and Text types there are things like support for styling, underlines, strikethoughs, and even (heaven forbid) sounds, movies and 3D.
</p>
<p>
Using native PDF annotations has one major drawback: you will have to save metadata back to the PDF file at some point.
At worst it could be impossible due to DRM, but in any case, you'd need to somehow remember that some of your documents might have private notes inside.
I get around it by making a copy of the file I'm about to annotate first, and giving it <samp class="inline">[annotated]</samp> prefix so I wouldn't confuse it with the original file.
</p>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org000000e">
<h3 id="org000000e"><a class="headerlink" href="#org000000e">¶</a>Okular, Evince, Atril</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000000e">
<p>
Probably most widely used PDF readers, all of these use <a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org">Poppler</a> library for working with PDF, which in particular does the messy business of annotation handling.
</p>
<p>
All of them would let you view existing annotations, but there are some nuances and limitations:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/atril">Atril</a> (as of 1.20.3) allows you to add or edit popup notes only, other types of annotations aren't even displayed in the sidebar</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Evince</a> (as of 3.32.0) only allows to add or edit highlights or popup notes (no inline!). Here is <a href="https://www.debugpoint.com/2016/05/evince-3-18-2-comes-with-text-and-highlight-annotation-in-ubuntu-16-04">article</a> with some screenshot (not much changed since 2016).
</p>
<p>
However it's got a nasty few years old bug (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/1567565">1</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evince/issues/868">2</a>) that doesn't allow you saving over the same file you're editing. That means that to work around it every time you want to persist your changes, you'd have to save to a new file and reopen the new copy. That makes it pretty unusable unless you only want to do couple of changes.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<a id="org000000b"></a><a href="https://okular.kde.org">Okular</a> (as of 1.6.3) allows <b><b>editing and adding pretty much every type of annotation</b></b> that you would expect: highlights, popup and inline notes, freehand and <a href="https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kdegraphics/okular/annotations.html">more</a>.
</p>
<p>
Annotation process (<a href="./annotating/okular.jpg">screenshot</a>) is pretty pleasant, hitting Ctrl-S results in saving the file you're working on without any problems.
</p>

<a id="org000000c"></a>Okular also got support for something called <a href="https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kdegraphics/okular/annotations.html">'document archive'</a>, which saves the original document in a zip file along with <samp class="inline">metadata.xml</samp>, which allows you to <b><b>annotate non-PDF files</b></b> (e.g. DJVU), which is a very neat feature. It's obviously Okular specific, in theory though it's possible to process <samp class="inline">metadata.xml</samp> with other tools.
</p>
<p>
<a id="org000000d"></a>Search in okular can't be restricted to annotations only and while you can use normal PDF search for inline notes and highlights (along with the other text that happened to match), it doesn't work at all for popups.
</p>
<p>
Even though Okular is part of KDE, there is no reason not to use it in other desktops environments, it's not that complicated in terms of UI; looks quite native in GTK, and few extra dependencies are barely a problem these days.

Pdf-tools (as of 0.90) is a PDF viewer for Emacs that meant to be more efficient than the builtin one (in terms of rendering), but is also capable of interacting with PDF metadata.

One big drawback is that to highlight and add new annotations you <b><b>still have to use mouse</b></b>, which loses half of the benefits of using Emacs for me.
Also it's got some minor issue displaying inline annotations text in the 'Content' buffer and annotations list (you can edit it if you click on it with your mouse though).

Org-noter (as of 1.3.0) allows you to annotate a PDF while keeping the text annotations in a separate <samp class="inline">org</samp> file which keep track of PDF locations in Org note properties.
<a href="https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter#screencast">Here's</a> a short demo.

Xournal is different from the above PDF viewers, since it isn't using types of annotations described in the PDF standard and instead uses its own <a href="http://xournal.sourceforge.net/manual.html#tools">tools</a>.

<p>
It doesn't modify the original files and instead keeps <samp class="inline">.xoj</samp> file containing the metadata and pointing at the original PDF, so in that sense it's pretty similar to <a class="link-up" href="#org000000c">okular</a>.

Two e-ink readers that support highlights and notes I know of are Kindle (I had Paperwhite 2) and Kobo (I own Kobo Aura One).
Highlighting works as you would expect on E-ink touchscreen (long press and dragging the selection); and you can leave notes by typing on a virtual keyboard (somewhat laggy, but ok for up to few sentences).
Perhaps the only differences are how you can search and access the annotations.

Kindle stores bookmarks, notes and highlights in <code class="inline">My Clippings.txt</code> on the device.
The good thing about the format is that it's already plaintext and fairly human readable, so you might be happy with that alone.
The format is a bit nasty for parsing (as you would expect from something with <samp class="inline">.txt</samp> extension). Dates are locale dependent, document locators may or may not have roman numerals, separators are inconsistent at times, etc. 
When I was using Kindle I was just copying the file from time to time, and you can set up some sort of automatic copying when your device is connected similarly to  what I'm doing with <a class="link-down" href="#org0000018">Kobo</a>.

But that's also restricted to books bought from Amazon.
</p>
<p>
<a id="org000001a"></a>Search function is somewhat limited: you can search in the book and it displays your highlights alongside content it found in the book, but you can't restrict search to highlights. You can't search in notes either.
Funny enough though, the <code class="inline">My Clipping.txt</code> file can be opened on Kindle itself (as any other <code class="inline">txt</code> file), and then you can search in it. It's not super convenient, but better than nothing. (I wasn't brave enough to try and see what happens if you try to highlight in this file.)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000021">
<p>
So far, for me the only downside of using nice tools for annotating digital content is that it ruined the experience of reading paper books for me. 
</p>
<p>
Usually I don't own the books I read, so using a highlighter or pencil would be just mean to the owner.
Even if you own the book and okay with that, it's still not searchable and not easily accessible, which feels very wrong to me.
</p>
<p>
To get around this I've tried few of tricks:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take pictures of bits I'm interested in, perhaps highlight using image editor on the phone</li>
<li>Sticky notes are ok for commenting as long as you don't damage the book with the glue, but they down help with highlighting</li>
<li><p>
Using paper strips as an annotation overlay.
</p>
<p>
This one I'm particularly proud of coming up to as I haven't found anyone else doing that, and I rarely come up with useful meatspace things.
</p>
<p>
This is how it looks in action: <a href="./annotating/paper-strips.jpg">photo</a>.
</p>
<p>
Basically, before reading, I prepare a bunch of paper strips slightly longer than the page height, kinda like bookmarks.
You will use it as a 'sidebar overlay' for writing notes and highlighting, so the width depends on your handwriting and how much you're expected to do that, I usually use something like 1/4 of the page.
</p>
<p>
If you want to annotate the page, you'll align strip's bottom to the bottom of the page and mark lines you found interesting on this strip and write comments on it as well. You can also use the other side of the strip to annotate the other page.
</p>
<p>
The downside of this is that in order to annotations to make sense, it requires a physical copy of exact same book.
Another one is that it doesn't have automatic timestamps, which somewhat bothers my <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#lifelogging">#lifelogging</a> OCD. You can get around it by writing down time as well, but that's quite distracting.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
When I'm done with a book, I'd spend a bit of time digitizing annotations and manually typing them into plaintext. Luckily, I don't have to do that often.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000022">
<p>
Often, I want to leave a quick comment to an org-mode item.
I've got a handy Emacs <a href="https://gitlab.com/karlicoss/dotspacemacs/blob/3f14fd054cef1ff95f6a376523cfae9bd1afe22b/init.el#L1019-1027">binding</a> which appends a child note with a timestamp and enters edit mode, so the whole process is smooth.
If you're not using org-mode you still can benefit from something similar, most of modern text editors allow you binding snippets on hotkeys.
</p>
<p>
One big drawback with Org mode (and I believe most of outline/task list formats) though is that if you insert child outline items in the middle of text,
it would structurally break it in two parts, so you'd have to append your commend to the end of current outline (which can be potentially very long).
On the other hand, plain list items, which you can insert in arbitrary place, are very limited and don't support most of things outline support like tags, timestamps, priorities etc.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000023">
<p>
Often when I watch lectures or some talks on Youtube or in VLC, I want to leave a bookmark or write a note with a reference to a specific timestamp. 
This is pretty much not possible apart from opening your text editor and manually recording the position in video. All the video annotation software I know of is more oriented towards video editing/effects etc.
</p>
<p>
So, if I'm watching something in browser, I normally end up using <a class="link-up" href="#grasp">grasp</a> and manually type the timestamp.
</p>
<p>
This is distracting, but even worse is that whatever you use have no means of quickly jumping to the timestamp you recorded; you'd have to move the slider to it manually. 
</p>
<p>
There is no common standard that I know of for jumping at a certain timestamp neither in web nor in desktop applications (e.g. via mime handler).
</p>
<p>
I'd say this is somewhat unsolved problem, which is surprising since presumably it could be helpful for lots of students.

However, judging by their <a href="https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs#3-resources">API</a>, there is no way to access your highlights.

UPD from <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2019-12-21]</span></span>: I gave it a try and it's actually pretty neat. They send you an email daily so you can practice spaced repetition with a single link click.
Personally I'm too invested in all of my own infrastructure, but if you want to try out spaced repetition without extra hassle, I highly recommend checking it out!

These are services that wouldn't let you select text. Not sure why that happens: could be some sort of copyright restriction, being assholes, or just accidental pointless restriction.

You can't use native text selection as Blinkist forces some custom JS for highlighting. But their highlights suck: you can't leave a comment and also they actively prevent you from selecting text forcing to use their own JS thing.
</p>
<p>
In addition you can't even export your highlights, best you can do seems to be <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/settings/external_services">syncing to an Evernote notebook</a>, and perhaps then you can use Evernote API. I didn't bother with it though.

<h2 id="vision"><a class="headerlink" href="#vision">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">6</span> What makes a good annotation system?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-vision">
<p>
In my quest for the perfect annotation engine I've figured certain aspects that make or would make an annotation tool pleasant to use.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b><b>Uniform</b></b>
</p>
<p>
Highlighting a piece of content and leaving a comment are fairly straightforward operations, and you shouldn't have to think much about how exactly you do it and which program you use.
Most current annotation engines are also somewhat tedious to interact with, add more content in existing annotations, link, etc.
</p>
<p>
Solving this requires the tools being <b><b>cross platform</b></b> and <b><b>cross format</b></b>.
</p>
<p>
<a class="link-up" href="#hypothesis">Hypothes.is</a> is the move in the right direction, but there are plenty of other things starting from unsupported formats and working offline to paper books which are missed out.
</p>
<p>
While current sad state of different tools/products for different forms of content is understandable, ideally it should be be <b><b>format agnostic</b></b> with some proper way of
<b><b>fingerprinting</b></b> content. If humans can tell whether a novel published online as HTML and a paper novel are the same thing, so can software.
</p>
<p>
Common standard (e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-annotation-model-20170223">Web Annotation Data Model</a>) is a good start, but even this one is pretty unknown and not widely accepted.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps in the near future we could exploit existing (fairly robust) OCR technologies and augmented reality to develop a universal annotation tool, but so far that's a whole different ballpark.
</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b><b>Ease of interaction</b></b>
</p>
<p>
Annotating is meant to augment your limited memory capabilities and using them should be <b><b>as easy as retrieving information from your brain</b></b>.
</p>
<p>
While brain-computer interfaces are not quite there, even with existing technologies you can achieve that with as little as few seconds lag just by using
plaintext representations, indexing and incremental search.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I'm solving this problem via <a class="link-down" href="#org0000000">orger</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b><b>Separate metadata</b></b>
</p>
<p>
Annotations layer should be loosely coupled to the underlying content. If it's not the case, it makes you too dependent on the specific tools, makes harder to keep track of your private data and to share data with other tools.
</p>
<p>
For physical sources of information it matters even more; although they might decline completely in few decades, who knows.
</p>
<p>
Good examples of this approach are <a class="link-up" href="#polar">Polar</a> and <a class="link-up" href="#hypothesis">Hypothesis</a> which keep metadata in well defined format with locators.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b><b>Data ownership and resilience</b></b>
</p>
<p>
If annotations make essential part of your knowledge, you want to be capable of accessing them <b><b>anytime</b></b>.
</p>
<p>
Ideally everything should work while fully offline without relying on any services.
</p>
<p>
Currently it's not always feasible due to technical complications (e.g. having to selfhost), but this is a good value to pursue.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<a name="social_function"></a> <b><b>Social and collaborative</b></b>
</p>
<p>
Annotations are a valuable tool for collaborative learning and research, and improving tools can make these activities more pleasant.
</p>
<p>
Blog comments seem to be somewhat in decline which is understandable since it's too annoying to register here and there.
On the other hand, platforms like Facebook comments or Disqus are not very privacy friendly, don't give access to data stored (e.g. if Disqus disappears tomorrow so do comments in your blog),
and are not very friendly towards people who do want to comment anonymously.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps in some near future we could <b><b>ditch all the internet commenting platforms</b></b> and rely on annotation layer instead.
<a class="link-up" href="#hypothesis">Hypothesis</a> basically lets you do that already, perhaps with a little work on design (sidebar is not necessarily convenient for social commenting), it could serve that purpose.
</p>
<p>
I also consider comments people write as projections of their minds and it would be great to give other people easier access to that to get to know each other better.
</p>
<p>
It's hardly worth mentioning that one should be in control whether highlights they are making are private or everyone else can see them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b><b>Open source</b></b>: not sure if that even needs justifying :)
</p>
<p>
People have somewhat different requirements for their cognitive tools and it should be possible to can hack them and fix annoying bugs.
That also gives way more potential for integrating them with other services.
</p></li>

<h2 id="infra"><a class="headerlink" href="#infra">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Using annotation data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-infra">
<p>
Considering there are multiple tools I have to use none of which is fully capable of doing everything I would ideally want from annotation system, I've developed my ways of getting closer to my <a class="link-up" href="#vision">ideal</a>.
For that I've got some infrastructure set up.
</p>
<p>
<b><b>Backups</b></b>: I've already mentioned script I'm using to back up Kobo database, for cloud services I'm running bunch of daily cron jobs that query APIs for data. Most of the job scripts are fairly ad-hoc and just a matter of GET query with properly set oauth token so perhaps not worth sharing, but let me know if you want something specific. These files are always synced across all of my devices, including phone, so I always have access to them.
</p>
<p>
That serves not just as data backup, but also as <b><b>data providers</b></b> for my tools. I only interact with these daily snapshots on filesystem rather than directly with API. That helps to avoid dealing with rate limiting, flakiness in network connection or API itself, and makes it way faster to iterate and develop. The only downside is that the data is not necessarily up to date, but perhaps you can dump data more often to get around this; I would still highly recommend you to prefer that to interacting with API directly. 
</p>
<p>
I'm using a <b><b>special Python package to access the data</b></b>, which I called <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/my"><code class="inline">my</code></a>. It's always in my <code class="inline">PYTHONPATH</code> so I can use it from any script/tool or REPL. It's got bunch of different submodules, e.g. <code class="inline">my.instapaper</code>, <code class="inline">my.kobo</code>, <code class="inline">my.polar</code> (and there are other modules as well). 
</p>

<p>
I chose org-mode as I was already used to its features, keybindings and metadata. Also the hierarchy (e.g. book → highlight → comments) fits naturally into outline format. But not that it's a real necessity, I feel that as long as it's searchable plaintext, it's good enough.
</p>
<p>
To search them, I've got a <b><b>global keybinding</b></b>, which invokes Emacs with incremental search prompt against the directory with rendered <samp class="inline">org</samp> files, which lets me interact with them in a blink on my computer. On Android I'm using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.docsearch">DocSearch</a> indexer (sadly it's not incremental, and app is not open source, so I'm looking for alternative). I describe this extensively <a href="pkm-search.html#personal_information">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I've got a <a href="https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll">Recoll</a> indexer instance + web interface running on my VPS; so if necessary I can access and search annotations via the internet.

<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org000002c">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-todos">
<p>
While reading, I often encounter something I want to google or check or read about later; or just come up to something actionable inspired by what I'm reading.
But I also don't want to interrupt from reading and losing context: that especially matters while reading on a E-ink device: distracting from the book, fetching your phone etc is really annoying.
</p>
<p>
So, as a workaround, I have programmed rules that pick out notes that start with "TODO" or marked with "TODO" tags; etc, and they are <b><b>automatically added to my agenda</b></b>. Later, when I see it on agenda, I'd assign it a priority and reschedule/unschedule depending on importance.

I'm writing about it in more detail in post about <a href="orger-todos.html">Orger</a>.

<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org000002d">
<h3 id="spaced_repetition"><a class="headerlink" href="#spaced_repetition">¶</a>Spaced repetition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-spaced_repetition">
<p>
It's kind of an extension of the previous use case: again, often you want to send something straight into your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> queue without having to remember to add that.
</p>
<p>
I've got two rules for that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if something is annotated with a certain marker ('drill' for me, comes from <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html">org-drill</a> package name)</li>
<li>if it's only got one word highlighted, which is useful for memorizing foreign words</li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org000002e">
<h3 id="org000002e"><a class="headerlink" href="#org000002e">¶</a>Life log</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000002e">
<p>
I'm a big fan of <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#lifelogging">#lifelogging</a> and all the timestamped highlights, comments and <a class="link-up" href="#org000001c">reading progress</a> from Kobo are an effortless (no manual logging!) contribution to my personal timeline, which I render and sync on my devices every few hours.
</p>
<p>
I sometimes use it when conversation with other people comes to awkward silence, so I can recall something I was reading recently and spark off an interesting (well at least for me) topic.

I'd be interested to know what do you think, and how are you managing your annotations or if you need some help with your existing workflow. Please also let me know if I missed any tools or features!
