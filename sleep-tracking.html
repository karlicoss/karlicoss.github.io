    <p>I’ve been tracking my sleep passively for a while. Not that I had any issues with sleep, but considering you spend massive chunk of your life sleeping, seems like a good idea to optimize it. After I bought <a href="https://www.emfit.com/sleep-sensing-solutions-with-hrv">Emfit</a> sleep tracker I figured it would be interesting to try correlating its stats with my subjective feelings.</p>
<p>Every morning, I log few things on the scale from 0 (bad) to 2 (good), one of which is something that I defined as “physical energy” (as opposed to mental energy). Well,</p>

<p>As you can see that’s not very fruitful (not sure what happened on 13 July 2018 lol). There are two possibilities here: my self introspection is really bad: many well being/mood tracking apps would let people estimate on the scale from 1 to 10, and I can’t even distinguish between three states.</p>
<p>Another one is that I’m just very stable and actually have no variation. For instance, I never had problems working out first thing in the morning, without having any food or stimulants. What bothers me a bit is that I don’t seem to experience any ‘high energy’ states either, which apparently people do.</p>
<p>I guess the lesson here is to reevaluate things I’m measuring after a short while and make sure I can actually track something meaningful or something I am capable of measuring.</p>
