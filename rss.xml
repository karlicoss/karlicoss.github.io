In <a href="orger.html">the first part</a> about Orger I wrote how I'm using it (in particular, the <code>orger.StaticView</code> component) to render my personal data as org-mode files
for easy, instant access and search.
</p>
<p>
Another generic application of Orger, is populating Org-mode files with outlines. 
In particular that means tasks for your agenda/spaced repetition routine or whatever else you could imagine it to be useful for.
</p>
<p>
Main goal was to minimize the overhead and distractions caused by creating todos by normal means (opening an app, copying some text, etc.).
Basically I want it to be completely seamless, almost without thinking at all.
</p>
<p>
You can use the target files as any of your normal org-mode files: modify contents, delete or reschedule tasks, etc.
When Orger detects new items they would be carefully and atomically appended to the end of file.
It keeps track of already processed items in a separate JSON file. All this nasty business is dealt with in <code>orger.InteractiveView</code> component.
</p>
<p>
You can find all of interactive Orger modules I'm using <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger/search?q=InteractiveView">on Github</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-reddit">
<p>
This one I have been sustainably using for almost a year now, so I believe it could be useful to many people.
</p>
<p>
I tend to be curious about lots of different topics so I'm subscribed to over 100 subreddits.
</p>
<p>
For the most part I'm reading Reddit passively and I can't afford spending much time on Reddit every day, so my system for years has been: reading updates for the past week on Sundays.
</p>
<p>
For few select subreddits that most interest me (e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/">quantifiedself</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode">orgmode</a>)
I read all updates, for the rest I just read weekly top.
</p>
<p>
I tend to do it from my phone on the go/in transport or while I'm waiting somewhere, so the concentration is not exactly perfect and many things are too awkward to read or browse on phone anyway.
</p>
<p>
So I tend to favorite interesting submissions (judging by the title) without reading them instead, and later once in a while when I'm at my desktop I have a deeper look at whatever I favorited.
</p>
<p>
This however gets a little clumsy. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
saved <b>items can't be rearranged</b> in the Reddit interface and the only sort available is by 'saving time'
</p>
<p>
This would be ok if every time you processed your saved items you cleared all of them, but that's just not very realistic.
</p>
<p>
Some things take higher priority; some things just give you few thoughts now and you wanna action on it later.
So every time you process saved submissions, you end up going through same things all over again, and you have to remember where you stopped last time. 
That's quite distracting!
</p></li>
<li><p>
you <b>can't add private comments</b> to saved items
</p>
<p>
Using some annotation engine like <a href="https://hypothes.is">Hypothesis</a> on 'Saved' page would be too flaky if Reddit changes design.
You could annotate saved items directly, but then you won't have an overview on 'Saved' page.
</p></li>
<li><p>
sometimes posts/comments get deleted so if you look at saved item months later, you'd not know what have you saved anymore
</p>
<p>
While there are ways to read removed reddit comments, it's a bit distracting to do too and with orger you'd always have an original version of the item.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
How Orger solves that for me? Here's my typical workflow with <code>reddit.org</code> file:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm running <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/rexport">reddit data exporter</a> and <code>reddit.py</code> every night automatically (via cron).</li>
<li>when I feel like reading some Reddit, I open <code>reddit.org</code> and jump to new items at the end of file (I can quickly tell them from old ones since they don't have a priority), and go through them</li>
<li>some things just get refiled immediately. E.g. if it's a recipe it would go to <code>food.org</code>, if it's something C++ related, it would go to <code>cpp.org</code>, etc.</li>
<li>what isn't refiled, I mark with a priority</li>
<li>when everything is prioritized, I select the whole file, call <code>org-sort-entries</code> and sort by priorities.</li>
<li><p>
now that everything looks a bit more manageable, I can action on the highest priority items (<code>#A</code> and <code>#B</code>) properly.
</p>
<p>
Some I just read and archive.
</p>
<p>
Some give me thoughts or ideas which I can add under the corresponding org-mode heading.
</p>
<p>
Some things just require actually acting on them (e.g. new library release), so I can mark it as TODO and schedule so it shows up in my agenda.
</p></li>
<li>also, once in a while I'll look through items with lower (<code>#C</code> / <code>#D</code>) priorities and bump them or archive if they become irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Needless to say when I'm searching through all of my Org-mode files, items saved on Reddit pop up as well.
</p>
<p>
The only downside of my particular implementation is that items are not unmarked as 'Saved' on Reddit.
One could probably implement this with API call on archiving/marking item as done or something, I just didn't find it too big of a deal for me.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-telegram2org">
<p>
</p>
<p>
Imagine a friend asked you for something, or sent you a link or a video, but you don't have time to process that right at the moment.
</p>
<p>
Normally I'd share their message to my TODO list app so I can process it later.
However, official Android app for Telegram doesn't have sharing capabilities.
</p>
<p>
This is a tool that allows you to overcome this restriction by forwarding messages you want to
remember about to a special private channel. Then it grabs the messages from this private channel and creates TODO items from it!
</p>
<p>
That way you keep your focus while not being mean ignoring your friends' messages.
</p>
<p>
I keep tags for the people I communicate most with (creepy I know :P ), so it also maps select people's names to tags,
so I can quickly have an overview of things to discuss or reply to.
</p>
<p>
It would be fairly straightforward to modify the code for other instant messengers, although there are some potential issues.
For instance, Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger don't have an API. You can potentially web scrape it or reverse engineer the database on your phone to get messages,
but I'm personally not motivated enough since I'm not using them much. Unless many people lack this, so let me know!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-hyp2org">
<p>
</p>
<p>
Sometimes when I'm annotating using <a href="https://hypothes.is">Hypothesis</a>, I want to think more
about specific highlights, google more about them later or generally act on them somehow.
</p>
<p>
Normally you'd have to copy the URL, highlighted text and create a task from it.
</p>
<p>
This script does that automatically, only thing that you have to do is to mark it with a tag or type 'todo'
in the annotation text.
</p>
<p>
Items get scheduled and appear on my org-mode agenda,
so I can un/reschedule them if they don't require immediate attention.
</p>
<p>
Modules for <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger/blob/master/modules/kobo2org.py">Kobo</a>

Automatically import stuff from my Kobo backups into org-mode for further spaced repetition (via org-drill in my case).
Mainly learning vocabulary with it.
</p>
<p>
It uses <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/kobuddy">kobuddy</a> to extract data from Kobo exports.
</p>
<p>
The name stands for K[oboD]rill.
</p>
<p>
I'm using <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html">org-drill</a> for Spaced repetition, but you could potentially use same principle to 
import cards in Anki or any other spaced repetition engine you like.

TLDR: I'll write about <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger">orger</a>, a tool I'm using to convert my personal data into easily readable and searchable org-mode views.
I'll present some examples and use cases, that will hopefully be helpful to you as well even if you are not sold by using my tool.
</p>
<p>
There is also <a href="orger-todos.html">second part</a> where I'm explaining how it can be used to process Reddit, create quick tasks from Telegram messages and help with spaced repetition.
If you're impatient, you can jump straight to a <a href="#demo">demo</a>.

<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org0000001">
<h2 id="intro"><a class="headerlink" href="#intro">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Intro</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
I consume lots of digital content (books, articles, reddit, youtube, reddit, etc.) and most of it I find somewhat useful and insightful.
I want to use that knowledge later, act and build on it. But there's an obstacle: human brain.
</p>
<p>
It would be cool to be capable of always remembering and instantly recalling information you've interacted with, metadata and your thoughts on it.
Until we get augmented though, there are two options: first is just to accept it and live with it. You might have guessed this is not the option I'm taking.
</p>
<div><span class="before-aside">
Second option is compensating for your sloppy meaty memory and having information you've read at hand and a quick way of searching over it. 

</span><aside>see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#extendedmind">#extendedmind</a></aside></div>
<p>
<a id="org0000000"></a>
That sounds simple enough but as with many simple things, on practice you run into obstacles. 
I'll give some I've personally been overcoming as examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>convenience of access, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to access highlights and notes on my Kobo ebook I need to actually reach my reader and tap through e-ink touch screen. Not much fun!</li>
<li>if you want to search over annotations in your PDF collections… well good luck, I'm just not aware of such a tool. Let alone the fact that many pdf viewers wouldn't even let you search through highlights within a single opened PDF file. TODO link annotations</li>
<li>there is no easy way to access all of your twitter favorites, people suggest using hacks like <a href="https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/131374/68104">autoscroll extension</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>searching data, e.g.:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>search function often just isn't available at all or search is not incremental, e.g. on Instapaper, you can't restrict search to highlights</li>
<li>builtin browser search (<code>Ctrl-F</code>) sucks for the most part: it's not very easy to navigate as you don't get previews and you have to look through every match</li>
<li>sometimes you vaguely recall reading about something but don't remember where exactly. Was it on stackoverflow? Or in some github issue? Or in a conversation with friend?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>data ownership and liberation, e.g.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what happens if data disappears or service is down (temporary/permanently) or banned by your government?</li>
<li><div><span class="before-aside">99% of services don't have support for offline mode. This may be just a small inconvenience if you're on a train or something, but there is more to it.
What if some sort of apocalypse happens and you lose all access to data? 
That depends on your paranoia level of course, and apocalypse is bad enough, but my take on it is that at least I'd have my data :) </span><aside>see <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#offline">#offline</a></aside></div></li>
<li>if you delete a book on Kobo, not only you can't access its annotations, but they seem to get <b>wiped</b> from the database.</li>
<li>in 2018, instapaper was unavailable in Europe for several months (!) due to missing the GDPR deadline</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Thinking about that and tinkering helped me understand what I want: some sort of <b><b>search engine</b></b>, over my <b><b>personal data</b></b>, with <b><b>uniform</b></b> and <b><b>always available</b></b> way of accessing it.
</p>
<p>
So, I present you a system that I've developed and that solves all my problems™: <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger">orger</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what">
<p>
It's really so quite trivial that it's almost stupid. Orger provides a simple python API to render any data as an Org-mode file. It's easier to give an example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span class="org-keyword">from</span> orger <span class="org-keyword">import</span> StaticView
<span class="org-keyword">from</span> orger.inorganic <span class="org-keyword">import</span> node, link
<span class="org-keyword">from</span> orger.common <span class="org-keyword">import</span> dt_heading

<span class="org-keyword">import</span> my.github_data

<span class="org-keyword">class</span> <span class="org-type">Github</span>(StaticView):
  <span class="org-keyword">def</span> <span class="org-function-name">get_items</span>(<span class="org-keyword">self</span>):
    <span class="org-keyword">for</span> event <span class="org-keyword">in</span> my.github_data.get_events():
      <span class="org-keyword">yield</span> node(dt_heading(event.dt, event.summary))

Github.main()
</pre>
</div>
<p>
That ten line program results in a file <code>Github.org</code>:

</div>
<p>
Even with event summaries only it can already be very useful to search over. What you can potentially do really depends on your imagination and needs! You can also add:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>links</li>
<li>tags</li>
<li>timestamps</li>
<li>properties</li>
<li>child nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>
See <a href="#examples">'Examples'</a> section for more.
</p>
<p>
So as you can see orger itself is a really not sophisticated tool, at least until you spend time trying to reimplement the same.
As always the devil is in the details (look at that cheeky <code>my.github_data</code> import), which I'll explain <a href="#org0000002">further</a>.

I'm using more than ten different Orger modules, most of which I've moved into the <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger/tree/master/modules">repository</a>. Here I'll describe some featured views I'm generating.
</p>
<p>
To give you a heads up, if you read the code, you'll see bunch of imports like <code>from my.hypothesis import ...</code>. 
I find it easier to move all data parsing in a separate <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/my"><code>my</code></a> package, that deals with parsing and converting input data (typically, some JSON). 
That makes everything less messy, separates data and rendering and lets me reuse abstract models in other tools. 
Also that lets me access my data from any python code, which makes it way easier to use and interact with data.
</p>
<p>
Some of these are still private so if you're interested in something not present in the github repo, please don't be shy and open an issue so I can prioritize.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully the code is readable enough and will give you some inspiration. 
If you find something confusing or you write your own module and want to contribute, please feel free to open issue/PR!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why_hard">
<p>
Well yeah it really does seem simple… until you try to do it.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
emitting Org-mode
</p>
<p>
While it's plaintext, and generating simple outlines is trivial, with more sophisticated inputs, there is some nasty business of escaping and sanitizing that has to be dealt with.
I didn't manage to find any Python libraries capable of emitting Org-mode. Only project I knew of was <a href="https://github.com/bjonnh/PyOrgMode">PyOrgMode</a> but the author abandoned it.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to generating 10+ views from different data sources, you <b>really</b> want to make sure it's as little effort and minimal boilerplate as it can possibly be.
</p>
<p>
That's how <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/inorganic">inorganic</a> library was born.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<a id="org0000002"></a>accessing data sources and exposing it through Python interfaces
</p>
<p>
This is probably where most of effort was spent. All sorts of stupid APIs, tedious parsing, you can imagine.
</p>
<p>
I'll write separately about it sometime, for now you can see some of the code I prettified and shared in my github <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic:export+user:karlicoss&amp;type=Repositories">'export'</a> and <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/my">my</a> packages.
I tried to make sure they are easy to use for other people and not specific to my use cases.
</p></li>
<li><p>
keeping track of already processed items for <code>Interactive</code> views
</p>
<p>
Because there is no feedback from org-mode files back to data sources, you want to keep track of items already added in the file, otherwise you're gonna have duplicates.
</p>
<p>
It's not rocket science of course, but it is quite tedious. There is some additional logic that checks for lock files, makes sure writes are atomic, etc. You really don't want to implement it more than once.
I figured it was worth extracting this 'pattern' in a separate <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger/blob/master/src/orger/state.py">python module</a>.

<li><p>
it solves <a href="#org0000000">my problems</a>! 
</p>
<p>
I won't go long into Org-mode propaganda, there are people that do it better than me out there, but for me it's good because it's a decent balance between ease of use and ease of augmenting.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it's easy to do unstructured (i.e. grep) or structured (i.e. tag search in emacs) search on any of your devices be it desktop or phone</li>
<li>you can open it anywhere you can open a text file</li>
<li>tasks as easy to create as any other Org outline so it can integrate with your todo list and agenda (see more in <a href="orger-todos.html">the second part</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
it doesn't require Emacs

written in Python. I don't claim at all that Python is the best programming language, but that's the one I'm most productive on as well as many other people.
</p>
<p>
Also the fact that it's a real programming language rather than some YAML config makes sure you can do anything and not restricted by stupid DSL.
</p></li>
<li>it's extremely easy to add new views — a matter of 10-20 lines of code.</li>
<li>agnostic to what you feed in it – it could be offline data from your regular backups, or it could be fresh API data. Again, it's a real programming language, you can do literally anything.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-using">
<p>
Apart from, obviously, opening org mode file in your favorite text editor, one major strength of this system is being able to search over them.
</p>
<p>
I'll write about my setup separately at some point, but for now I'll give a quick summary and clues.
</p>
<p>
On my desktop I'm just using spacemacs or <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/cloudmacs">cloudmacs</a> from web browser.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm usually just using <a href="https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag">helm-ag</a> with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> (your can find how to marry them <a href="https://gist.github.com/pesterhazy/fabd629fbb89a6cd3d3b92246ff29779">here</a>).</li>
<li>sometimes <a href="https://github.com/emacsorphanage/helm-swoop">helm-swoop</a> is very convenient, especially <code>helm-multi-swoop</code> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These two are incremental (instant feedback) and effectively instantaneous. For more structured search you could use:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>good old <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html"><code>org-tags-view</code></a></li>
<li>org-ql with <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql#helm-org-ql"><code>helm-org-ql</code></a> is a nicer and incremental alternative</li>
</ul>
<p>
On my Android phone I'm using <a href="https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android">orglzy</a> for structured search/viewing Org-mode files. 
Sometimes <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.docsearch.pro">Docsearch +</a> is also useful, which is indexing plaintext files and lets you search in them. While it's not tailored for org-mode files, it's usually good enough for me.
</p>
<p>
You can also set up some proper indexing daemon like <a href="https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll">recoll</a>.

<h3 id="org0000011"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000011">¶</a>Typical use patterns</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000011">
<p>
I'll just give some of my use cases:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
While running tests for <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orgparse">orgparse</a> I started randomly getting  <code>AssertionError: Cannot find component 'A@3' for 'orgparse.A@3</code>. 
</p>
<p>
I recall that I had same issue few month ago but don't quite remember what was the fix. 
I press <code>F1</code> which invokes <code>helm-ag</code> for me and type 'cannot find component'.
I instantly find a github <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/7281">issue</a> I opened in <code>github.org</code> and figure out what I need to do to work around the problem.
</p></li>
<li><p>
While discussing special relativity with a friend, I recall watching some intuitive rationale for Maxwell's equations, but don't quite recall what was the video.
</p>
<p>
I press <code>F1</code>, type 'Special relativity' and instantly get few results, in particular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0">this</a> awesome Veritasium video in <code>youtube.org</code>, which I was looking for.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Recommending books
</p>
<p>
I often struggle to recall the details why I liked a particular book, especially fiction.
Having all annotations in my <code>kobo.org</code> file lets me quickly look up and skim through highlighted bits so I can freshen up my memory.

It would be cool to implement feedback from emacs, e.g. editing Github comment when you edit the corresponding Orger item. But it requires considerably more effort and would only work within emacs.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000016">
<p>
Unfortunately there is a little space for race condition if Orger appends something while you're editing file. 
Orger tries to detect emacs and vim swap/lock files, but it's if you're very unlucky or using different setup it's still possible.
Hopefully your text editor warns you when the file had been overwritten while you were editing it (e.g. as emacs does).
</p>
<p>
Also I run Orger jobs at night (via cron) so it's quite unlikely to overlap with editing anything.

    <h1>Cloudmacs and getting to know Docker</h1>
    
    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p>
TLDR: I'm running my spacemacs as a web service on my VPS, <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/cloudmacs">check it out too</a>.
</p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/291333/64866462-26e25c80-d644-11e9-9ad5-ad9d9808b0cb.png" width="auto" />
<p>
Since I've became hooked on emacs, I've been looking for ways to have same experience in my browser.
Sometimes you have to use non-personal computers where it's not possible/undesirable to install desktop Emacs and Dropbox/Syncthing to access your personal data. 
So I've been looking for some cloud solution since I've got a VPS.
</p>
<p>
The closest tool to what I wanted was <a href="https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash">Filestash</a>: it suports vim/emacs bindings and some <a href="https://www.filestash.app/2018/05/31/release-note-v0.1">org-mode goodies</a>.
However, it wasn't anywhere as convenient as emacs. Also after an update it somehow broke my Dropbox connection to the directory with org-mode notes, which rendered it useless for me. I'm also moving from Dropbox to Syncthing, so was planning to abandon Filestash anyway as it doesn't allow local files, only ftp or git.
</p>
<p>
Dropbox is not capable of previewing arbitrary text files let alone edit; and even if it could you obviously wouldn't get anything close to your usual emacs workflow.
</p>
<p>
And you could imagine that while elisp/vim style editing is fairly application <a href="https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys#vim-editor-and-emacs-editor">agnostic</a>, it's a thankless job to rewrire/port all the amazing emacs packages and features I'm used to like neotree, helm, refile, swoop, agenda, projectile, org-drill etc.
</p>
<p>
So I figured the only thing that would keep me happy is to run emacs itself over the web! Thankfully, due to its TUI interface that works surprisingly well.
</p>
<p>
It works <b><b>really</b></b> well with spacemacs/evil style <code>SPC</code> and comma bindings because they for the most part don't overlap with OS/browser hotkeys.
</p>
<p>
Also it's the first time I properly used Docker apart from running other people's containers so here are few non-obvious things I learnt which you might find useful:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build">Multistage build</a> is a painless way to extend someone else's containers or combine several containers in one</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg">build time variables</a> is a nice way to make your container more amendable, e.g. you can avoid hardcoding versions if you use it</li>
<li><p>
Perhaps the trickiest one: docker reuses the host kernel and as a consequence same user IDs, so if you built your container as root (which is normally the case if you pull from Docker Hub), your container will write back to mounted volumes as root too!
</p>
<p>
To get around that there is a somewhat hacky <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/cloudmacs/blob/master/asEnvUser">asEnvUser</a> script and custom <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/cloudmacs/blob/master/compose">docker-compose wrapper</a> that take care of preserving user ID. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The other day I got curious how Endomondo estimates energy expenditure during the exercise.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://support.endomondo.com/hc/en-us/articles/201861383-Calories">their website</a>, they mention some paywalled paper, but no specifics, so I figured it'd be interesting to reverse engineer that myself. I've extracted endomondo data from their JSON export and plotted a regression.</p>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://uk.wahoofitness.com/devices/heart-rate-monitors/wahoo-tickr-x-heart-rate-strap">Wahoo TickrX chest strap monitor</a>, so the HR data coming from it is pretty decent.</p>

<p>First, I'm importing the dataframe from the python package I'm using to interact with my data. (I've mentioned it <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/annotating.html#infra">here</a>).</p>
<p>It's private at the moment, but it's pretty specific to my use cases and the only interfacing in this post it through Pandas dataframe, so hopefully that wouldn't confuse you.</p>

<p>Heartbeats were calculated as average HR multiplied by the duration of exercise.</p>
<p>Error column is a neat way of propagating exceptions from data provider.</p>
<p>E.g. I only have HR data for the last couple of years or so, so data provider doesn't have any of HR points from endomondo. While I could filter out these points in the data provider, they might still be useful for other plots and analysis pipelines (e.g. if I was actually only interested in kcals and didn't hare about heartbeats).</p>
<p>Instead, I'm just being defensive and propagating exceptions up through the dataframe, leaving it up to the user to handle them.</p>

<p>Unsurprising, it looks like a simple linear model (considering my weight and age barely changed).</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that for instance for me, running feels way more intense than any of other cardio I'm doing, definitely way harder than skiing!</p>
<p>However the regression coeffecient (basically, calories burnt per 'unit of heart activity') is more or less same. I guess that could potentially be explained by the fact that running involves more muscle activity, which Endomondo can't capture and doesn't try to infer from the exercise type (which you enter manually when you start logging the exercise).</p>
<p>With regards to the actual regression coefficient: seaborn wouldn't let you display them on the regplot (the author has a very strong opition about that, <a href="https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/655#issuecomment-370079702">apparently</a>), so we use <code>sklearn</code> to do that for us:</p>

TLDR: when I read I try to read <a href="https://help.open.ac.uk/active-reading">actively</a>, which for me mainly involves using various tools to annotate content: highlight and leave notes as I read. I've programmed <a href="#infra">data providers</a> that parse them and provide nice interface to interact with this data from other tools. My <a href="#org0000000">automated scripts</a> use them to render these annotations in human readable and searchable plaintext and generate <a href="#org0000001">TODOs</a>/<a href="#org0000002">spaced repetition</a> items.
</p>
<p>
In this post I'm gonna elaborate on all of that and give some motivation, review of these tools (mainly with the focus on open source thus extendable software) and my vision on how they could work in an ideal world.
I won't try to convince you that my method of reading and interacting with information is superior for you: it doesn't have to be, and there are people out there more eloquent than me who do that. I assume you want this too and wondering about the practical details.

At some point in my life I realized I didn't remember most of the books/papers/posts/videos I had consumed few years before. 
</span><aside class="sidenote">For brevity I'll just refer to all of this as 'content' further on</aside></div>
<p>
That bothered me increasingly until I bought a Kindle which had 'highlight' functionality and virtual keyboard; and I had discovered it to help a lot with recalling.
</p>
<p>
I've become increasingly obsessed with this and these days ability to highlight when I read serves multiple purposes for me:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the very act of spending conscious effort on highlighting and commenting helps to remember better.</li>
<li><p>
it's easier to recall the content I already read, I just skim through highlights and refresh the memory
</p>
<p>
In particular, often I'd run on something on the internet that I remember reading before. If I have annotations for that, I can quickly go through them and restore the context.
</p></li>
<li>it's easier to recommend content to other people because you can refer to specific moments or points you liked/disliked</li>
<li>it's got social value if highlights are visible to other people (e.g. <a href="#hypothesis">Hypothesis</a>, Medium, Goodreads)</li>
<li>it helps with <a href="./notes.html#book_scoring">book scoring</a>. If I don't have any highlights, it probably means that the content was not interesting at all for me. Fiction books are not an exception: I tend to highlight use of language I liked, inspirational things, etc.</li>
<li>it serves as activity log if you are into <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#lifelogging">#lifelogging</a>.</li>
<li>you can <a href="#org0000001">populate your TODO list</a> and <a href="#org0000002">step up your spaced repetition game</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm going to review some of the tools I tried using and still using and highlight their different positive and negative aspects. If you're getting impatient, you can skip straight to my <a href="#comparison">comparison table</a>.

<p>
I won't really write much about it for one reason which is a big deal: while you can highlight text, you can't leave notes. Nearest functionality is 'recommending' a highlight while reading a comment, but that's only displayed on your 'timeline'.
</p>
<p>
Pocket API doesn't support exporting highlights too, or to be precise it seems to be hidden. If you need it you can use <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/pockexport">my script</a> where I hacked around it.

Also, interesting enough, <a href="#kobo">Kobo reader</a> has got Pocket integration, but for some reason when you read Pocket articles on Kobo, you can't highlight at all (let alone syncing highlights with Pocket). Not sure what's the purpose of this integration.
</p>
<p>
Pocket was acquired by Mozilla in 2017, which might be a good thing, but so far their main focus seem to be readability features.

I won't go into Instapaper's readability capabilities (e.g. fonts and article formatting) because it's not something I care much about, so you might be better off googling that for yourself, here I'll concentrate on annotating aspect. 
Here are couple of recent extensive comparisons of Instapaper and Pocket, which feature screenshots and other aspects of Instapaper:

</ul>
<p>
So, to read something in Instapaper, first you'll have to import the article into it (to unclutter and optimize it for reading). 
Due to this import process, you can <b><b>only read and highlight in Instapaper's app</b></b>, and you can only see your highlights there as well, which is its main limitation for me.
</p>
<p>
The only reason I'm using it at all is that its Android app has got <b><b>offline</b></b> capabilities, so I would export to Instapaper things I want to read on the tube while I don't have connection and read/comment while offline.
</p>
<p>
Mind that free version of Instapaper has got <b><b>5 notes per month limit</b></b>. Personally I'm happy to pay 3$ per month for <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/premium">premium version</a> of such a decent product though in absence of good alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Instapaper got <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/api">Json API</a>, through which you can access your saved articles, comments and highlights. I'm using a <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/instapaper">fork</a> of python wrapper to access it. Highlights are only stored as text though (as opposed to CSS/xpath locators), so there is no easy way to match them against original text apart from some sort of fuzzy search. 
</p>
<p>
<a id="org0000005"></a>Search function works for full text search in saved articles, but doesn't let you restrict search for highlights, and you can't search in notes at all.
</p>
<p>
One red flag was in 2018 when Instapaper wasn't available in Europe for few months until they resolved GDPR issues. While I don't blame it on Instapaper, this is a kind of thing that happens when you don't own your data and use a closed source product.

Wallabag is the most mature open source/selfhosted read-it-later kind of project I know of. <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/7/wallabag">Here's</a> a review featuring some screenshots of their web app and Android app.
</p>
<p>
It's very similar to Instapaper in terms of <b><b>having to import</b></b> the article in Wallabag in order to annotate it. I used it for a while and only had some issues with importing articles heavy on MathJax backed Latex.
</p>
<p>
If you don't want to selfhost it, you can use <a href="https://www.wallabag.it/en">wallabag.it</a> hosting for as little as 9 euros per year and two weeks of trial.

<p>
Hypothesis is simply awesome and my favorite web annotation tool. Their killer feature is that it embeds a bit of JS in the page to provide an <b><b>in-browser overlay</b></b>, so you don't have to leave the page you were reading and can highlight and add comments natively.
They use something cool called <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/fuzzy-anchoring">fuzzy anchoring</a> to achieve this.
That also makes annotations <b><b>resilient to document markup changes</b></b>, and if they can't locate your annotations it would be still shown in metadata as <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/showing-orphaned-annotations">'orphaned'</a>, so you never lose your notes.
</p>
<p>
Another cool feature is that you can choose to make your annotations public and see other people's annotations or create a private group if you want to share them among specific people only.
</p>
<p>
To get a sense of it you can skim through <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotation-basics">tutorial</a> which has plenty of screenshots,
and I also strongly recommend you checking it out in action here: <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard">Annotation Is Now a Web Standard</a>,
or try the very page <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://beepb00p.xyz/annotating.html#hypothesis">you're reading now</a>.
</p>
<p>
You don't have to install anything or register, it's just a widget embedded in the page, but do make sure to allow JS.
You should see yellow highlights and the sidebar on the right.
</p>
<p>
It's open source, can be selfhosted and they provide their own service for free (but please consider donating them!).
</p>
<p>
Since Hypothesis powered by javascript, it actually works well in modern <b><b>Android</b></b> browsers via <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/start/">bookmarklet</a>.
It's somewhat not obvious in terms of browser UI how to actually use them though:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for mobile Firefox, once you added a bookmarklet, to invoke it you need to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/3uquy5/do_bookmarklets_work_in_firefox_browser_for/cxh8uvq">tap on the address bar</a> and click the bookmarklet.</li>
<li>for mobile Chrome, it's a bit more tedious but also <a href="https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/159308/how-can-a-bookmarklet-be-added-on-mobile-chrome">possible</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
One downside of this service is that you won't be able to annotate while offline.
I feel it's actually more of mobile browser's problem in general rather than Hypothesis though.
While you potentially can annotate offline without querying API and preserving data in <code>localStorage</code>, if you can't load the page in the first place, it doesn't matter. Perhaps that can be given better support in browsers.
</p>
<p>
Hypothesis got <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/v1/#tag/annotations/paths/~1search/get">JSON API</a> which gives access to your and other people's public annotations.
I'm using <a href="https://github.com/judell/Hypothesis">judell/Hypothesis</a> python wrapper to access and back up this data.

Shameless plug! If you just want to send annotations directly into a plaintext (e.g. org-mode) file and don't really care about displaying them within the original web page you can use my <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/grasp">grasp</a> browser addon for that.

<p>
Small disclaimer: I don't own a Mac so have no idea what's going on in their world. Sorry!  (UPD: I got <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1147473985514459137">few recommendations</a> from a follower, perhaps they would be helpful).
</p>
<p>
PDF format is a complicated beast, and its native annotations are a whole different story to annotating web.
</p>
<p>
First, its ISO standard is <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63534.html">not freely available</a>. Adobe website has got some sort of <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html">reference</a>
which is not the same as standard, but apparently close enough.
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few different kinds of PDF annotations, e.g. you can see them here in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/PDF32000_2008.pdf">section 12.5.6: Annotation Types</a> or in <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/blob/a4d3db87c3bae5e2a364c828479a6cbb0277069e/poppler/Annot.h#L606-634">Poppler source code</a>.
In addition to Highlight and Text types there are things like support for styling, underlines, strikethoughs, and even (heaven forbid) sounds, movies and 3D.
</p>
<p>
Using native PDF annotations has one major drawback: you will have to save metadata back to the PDF file at some point.
At worst it could be impossible due to DRM, but in any case, you'd need to somehow remember that some of your documents might have private notes inside.
I get around it by making a copy of the file I'm about to annotate first, and giving it <code>[annotated]</code> prefix so I wouldn't confuse it with the original file.

<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org0000010">
<h3 id="org0000010"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000010">¶</a>Okular, Evince, Atril</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000010">
<p>
Probably most widely used PDF readers, all of these use <a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org">Poppler</a> library for working with PDF, which in particular does the messy business of annotation handling.
</p>
<p>
All of them would let you view existing annotations, but there are some nuances and limitations:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/atril">Atril</a> (as of 1.20.3) allows you to add or edit popup notes only, other types of annotations aren't even displayed in the sidebar</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Evince</a> (as of 3.32.0) only allows to add or edit highlights or popup notes (no inline!). Here is <a href="https://www.debugpoint.com/2016/05/evince-3-18-2-comes-with-text-and-highlight-annotation-in-ubuntu-16-04">article</a> with some screenshot (not much changed since 2016).
</p>
<p>
However it's got a nasty few years old bug (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/1567565">1</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evince/issues/868">2</a>) that doesn't allow you saving over the same file you're editing. That means that to work around it every time you want to persist your changes, you'd have to save to a new file and reopen the new copy. That makes it pretty unusable unless you only want to do couple of changes.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<a id="org000000d"></a><a href="https://okular.kde.org">Okular</a> (as of 1.6.3) allows <b><b>editing and adding pretty much every type of annotation</b></b> that you would expect: highlights, popup and inline notes, freehand and <a href="https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kdegraphics/okular/annotations.html">more</a>.
</p>
<p>
Annotation process (<a href="./annotating/okular.jpg">screenshot</a>) is pretty pleasant, hitting Ctrl-S results in saving the file you're working on without any problems.
</p>
<p>
<a id="org000000e"></a>Okular also got support for something called <a href="https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kdegraphics/okular/annotations.html">'document archive'</a>, which saves the original document in a zip file along with <code>metadata.xml</code>, which allows you to <b><b>annotate non-PDF files</b></b> (e.g. DJVU), which is a very neat feature. It's obviously Okular specific, in theory though it's possible to process <code>metadata.xml</code> with other tools.
</p>
<p>
<a id="org000000f"></a>Search in okular can't be restricted to annotations only and while you can use normal PDF search for inline notes and highlights (along with the other text that happened to match), it doesn't work at all for popups.
</p>
<p>
Even though Okular is part of KDE, there is no reason not to use it in other desktops environments, it's not that complicated in terms of UI; looks quite native in GTK, and few extra dependencies are barely a problem these days.

One big drawback is that to highlight and add new annotations you <b><b>still have to use mouse</b></b>, which loses half of the benefits of using Emacs for me.

It doesn't modify the original files and instead keeps <code>.xoj</code> file containing the metadata and pointing at the original PDF, so in that sense it's pretty similar to <a href="#org000000e">okular</a>.

Kindle stores bookmarks, notes and highlights in <code>My Clippings.txt</code> on the device.
The good thing about the format is that it's already plaintext and fairly human readable, so you might be happy with that alone.
The format is a bit nasty for parsing (as you would expect from something with <code>.txt</code> extension). Dates are locale dependent, document locators may or may not have roman numerals, separators are inconsistent at times, etc. 
When I was using Kindle I was just copying the file from time to time, and you can set up some sort of automatic copying when your device is connected similarly to  what I'm doing with <a href="#org000001a">Kobo</a>.

, but it <b><b>only</b></b> works for stuff bought on Kindle store. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/6sttez/the_new_amazon_highlights_system">Reportedly</a> people also have issues displaying their highlights on Cloud Reader due to copyright restrictions.
</p>
<p>
<a id="org000001b"></a>Kindle also <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/share-kindle-notes-highlights-friends">integrates with Goodreads</a>, which synchronizes reading progress and lets you selectively share annotations to Goodreads.
But that's also restricted to books bought from Amazon.
</p>
<p>
<a id="org000001c"></a>Search function is somewhat limited: you can search in the book and it displays your highlights alongside content it found in the book, but you can't restrict search to highlights. You can't search in notes either.
Funny enough though, the <code>My Clipping.txt</code> file can be opened on Kindle itself (as any other <code>txt</code> file), and then you can search in it. It's not super convenient, but better than nothing. (I wasn't brave enough to try and see what happens if you try to highlight in this file.)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000023">
<p>
So far, for me the only downside of using nice tools for annotating digital content is that it ruined the experience of reading paper books for me. 
</p>
<p>
Usually I don't own the books I read, so using a highlighter or pencil would be just mean to the owner.
Even if you own the book and okay with that, it's still not searchable and not easily accessible, which feels very wrong to me.
</p>
<p>
To get around this I've tried few of tricks:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take pictures of bits I'm interested in, perhaps highlight using image editor on the phone</li>
<li>Sticky notes are ok for commenting as long as you don't damage the book with the glue, but they down help with highlighting</li>
<li><p>
Using paper strips as an annotation overlay.
</p>
<p>
This one I'm particularly proud of coming up to as I haven't found anyone else doing that, and I rarely come up with useful meatspace things.
</p>
<p>
This is how it looks in action: <a href="./annotating/paper-strips.jpg">photo</a>.
</p>
<p>
Basically, before reading, I prepare a bunch of paper strips slightly longer than the page height, kinda like bookmarks.
You will use it as a 'sidebar overlay' for writing notes and highlighting, so the width depends on your handwriting and how much you're expected to do that, I usually use something like 1/4 of the page.
</p>
<p>
If you want to annotate the page, you'll align strip's bottom to the bottom of the page and mark lines you found interesting on this strip and write comments on it as well. You can also use the other side of the strip to annotate the other page.
</p>
<p>
The downside of this is that in order to annotations to make sense, it requires a physical copy of exact same book.
Another one is that it doesn't have automatic timestamps, which somewhat bothers my <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#lifelogging">#lifelogging</a> OCD. You can get around it by writing down time as well, but that's quite distracting.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
When I'm done with a book, I'd spend a bit of time digitizing annotations and manually typing them into plaintext. Luckily, I don't have to do that often.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000024">
<p>
Often, I want to leave a quick comment to an org-mode item.
I've got a handy Emacs <a href="https://gitlab.com/karlicoss/dotspacemacs/blob/3f14fd054cef1ff95f6a376523cfae9bd1afe22b/init.el#L1019-1027">binding</a> which appends a child note with a timestamp and enters edit mode, so the whole process is smooth.
If you're not using org-mode you still can benefit from something similar, most of modern text editors allow you binding snippets on hotkeys.
</p>
<p>
One big drawback with Org mode (and I believe most of outline/task list formats) though is that if you insert child outline items in the middle of text,
it would structurally break it in two parts, so you'd have to append your commend to the end of current outline (which can be potentially very long).
On the other hand, plain list items, which you can insert in arbitrary place, are very limited and don't support most of things outline support like tags, timestamps, priorities etc.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000025">
<p>
Often when I watch lectures or some talks on Youtube or in VLC, I want to leave a bookmark or write a note with a reference to a specific timestamp. 
This is pretty much not possible apart from opening your text editor and manually recording the position in video. All the video annotation software I know of is more oriented towards video editing/effects etc.
</p>
<p>
So, if I'm watching something in browser, I normally end up using <a href="#grasp">grasp</a> and manually type the timestamp.
</p>
<p>
This is distracting, but even worse is that whatever you use have no means of quickly jumping to the timestamp you recorded; you'd have to move the slider to it manually. 
</p>
<p>
There is no common standard that I know of for jumping at a certain timestamp neither in web nor in desktop applications (e.g. via mime handler).
</p>
<p>
I'd say this is somewhat unsolved problem, which is surprising since presumably it could be helpful for lots of students.

Due to the lack of common standard for annotated content, some services try to implement their own:

<li><p>
<a href="https://medium.com/@wiobyrne/getting-started-in-medium-reading-annotating-commenting-and-recommending-757f43be83ee">Medium</a>. They use   highlights and annotation that also serve social function: when you read a Medium post you can see if a certain bit of text was highlighted by many other people.
</p>
<p>
They don't tamper with browser selection, so you can still use external annotation tools like Hypothesis. However, judging by their <a href="https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs#3-resources">API</a>, there is no way to access your highlights. Anyway, I would encourage people not to use these especially if you only care about personal use, after all Medium is not the only source of information out there.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0000027">
<p>
These are services that wouldn't let you select text. Not sure why that happens: could be some sort of copyright restriction, being assholes, or just accidental pointless restriction.

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.blinkist.com">Blinkist</a>: Android app and website.
</p>
<p>
You can't use native text selection as Blinkist forces some custom JS for highlighting. But their highlights suck: you can't leave a comment and also they actively prevent you from selecting text forcing to use their own JS thing.
</p>
<p>
In addition you can't even export your highlights, best you can do seems to be <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/settings/external_services">syncing to an Evernote notebook</a>, and perhaps then you can use Evernote API. I didn't bother with it though.

<h2 id="vision"><a class="headerlink" href="#vision">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">6</span> What makes a good annotation system?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-vision">
<p>
In my quest for the perfect annotation engine I've figured certain aspects that make or would make an annotation tool pleasant to use.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b><b>Uniform</b></b>
</p>
<p>
Highlighting a piece of content and leaving a comment are fairly straightforward operations, and you shouldn't have to think much about how exactly you do it and which program you use.
Most current annotation engines are also somewhat tedious to interact with, add more content in existing annotaions, link, etc.
</p>
<p>
Solving this requires the tools being <b><b>cross platform</b></b> and <b><b>cross format</b></b>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#hypothesis">Hypothes.is</a> is the move in the right direction, but there are plenty of other things starting from unsupported formats and working offline to paper books which are missed out.
</p>
<p>
While current sad state of different tools/products for different forms of content is understandable, ideally it should be be <b><b>format agnostic</b></b> with some proper way of
<b><b>fingerprinting</b></b> content. If humans can tell whether a novel published online as HTML and a paper novel are the same thing, so can software.
</p>
<p>
Common standard (e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-annotation-model-20170223">Web Annotation Data Model</a>) is a good start, but even this one is pretty unknown and not widely accepted.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps in the near future we could exploit existing (fairly robust) OCR technologies and augmented reality to develop a universal annotation tool, but so far that's a whole different ballpark.
</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b><b>Ease of interaction</b></b>
</p>
<p>
Annotating is meant to augment your limited memory capabilities and using them should be <b><b>as easy as retrieving information from your brain</b></b>.
</p>
<p>
While brain-computer interfaces are not quite there, even with existing technologies you can achieve that with as little as few seconds lag just by using
plaintext representations, indexing and incremental search.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I'm solving this problem via <a href="#org0000000">orger</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b><b>Separate metadata</b></b>
</p>
<p>
Annotations layer should be loosely coupled to the underlying content. If it's not the case, it makes you too dependent on the specific tools, makes harder to keep track of your private data and to share data with other tools.
</p>
<p>
For physical sources of information it matters even more; although they might decline completely in few decades, who knows.
</p>
<p>
Good examples of this approach are <a href="#polar">Polar</a> and <a href="#hypothesis">Hypothesis</a> which keep metadata in well defined format with locators.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b><b>Data ownership and resilience</b></b>
</p>
<p>
If annotations make essential part of your knowledge, you want to be capable of accessing them <b><b>anytime</b></b>.
</p>
<p>
Ideally everything should work while fully offline without relying on any services.
</p>
<p>
Currently it's not always feasible due to technical complications (e.g. having to selfhost), but this is a good value to pursue.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b><b>Social and collaborative</b></b>
</p>
<p>
Annotations are a valuable tool for collaborative learning and research, and improving tools can make these activities more pleasant.
</p>
<p>
Blog comments seem to be somewhat in decline which is understandable since it's too annoying to register here and there.
On the other hand, platforms like Facebook comments or Disqus are not very privacy friendly, don't give access to data stored (e.g. if Disqus disappears tomorrow so do comments in your blog),
and are not very friendly towards people who do want to comment anonymously.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps in some near future we could <b><b>ditch all the internet commenting platforms</b></b> and rely on annotation layer instead.
<a href="#hypothesis">Hypothesis</a> basically lets you do that already, perhaps with a little work on design (sidebar is not necessarily convenient for social commenting), it could serve that purpose.
</p>
<p>
I also consider comments people write as projections of their minds and it would be great to give other people easier access to that to get to know each other better.
</p>
<p>
It's hardly worth mentioning that one should be in control whether highlights they are making are private or everyone else can see them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b><b>Open source</b></b>: not sure if that even needs justifying :)
</p>
<p>
People have somewhat different requirements for their cognitive tools and it should be possible to can hack them and fix annoying bugs.
That also gives way more potential for integrating them with other services.
</p></li>

<h2 id="infra"><a class="headerlink" href="#infra">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Using annotation data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-infra">
<p>
Considering there are multiple tools I have to use none of which is fully capable of doing everything I would ideally want from annotation system, I've developed my ways of getting closer to my <a href="#vision">ideal</a>.
For that I've got some infrastructure set up.
</p>
<p>
<b><b>Backups</b></b>: I've already mentioned script I'm using to back up Kobo database, for cloud services I'm running bunch of daily cron jobs that query APIs for data. Most of the job scripts are fairly ad-hoc and just a matter of GET query with properly set oauth token so perhaps not worth sharing, but let me know if you want something specific. These files are always synced across all of my devices, including phone, so I always have access to them.
</p>
<p>
That serves not just as data backup, but also as <b><b>data providers</b></b> for my tools. I only interact with these daily snapshots on filesystem rather than directly with API. That helps to avoid dealing with rate limiting, flakiness in network connection or API itself, and makes it way faster to iterate and develop. The only downside is that the data is not necessarily up to date, but perhaps you can dump data more often to get around this; I would still highly recommend you to prefer that to interacting with API directly. 
</p>
<p>
I'm using a <b><b>special Python package to access the data</b></b>, which I called <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/my"><code>my</code></a>. It's always in my <code>PYTHONPATH</code> so I can use it from any script/tool or REPL. It's got bunch of different submodules, e.g. <code>my.reading.instapaper</code>, <code>my.reading.kobo</code>, <code>my.reading.polar</code> (there are other modules than <code>my.reading</code>, but that material for a whole separate post). The package itself is not public since it happens to have some personal data in it, at some point I'll try to strip it off and release it (not sure if it would be really relevant for other people anyway).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000002b">
<p>
As a specific example how I do it: recently my friend asked me if I could recommend them posts I found interesting on <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Slate Star Codex</a>. With a tiny python script I was quickly able to give them some stats on posts I read, so they could choose among them.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000002c">
<p>
<a id="org0000000"></a>I've got bunch of scripts and a rendering tool which I named <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger">orger</a> (yep, haven't invested that much thought into naming).
Basically, these scripts take specific data source as input and produce org-mode output, e.g. renders <code>json</code> backed up from Instapaper into <code>instapaper.org</code> file. That runs every few hours and keeps the contents relatively up to date.
</p>
<p>
I chose org-mode as I was already used to its features, keybindings and metadata. Also the hierarchy (e.g. book → highlight → comments) fits naturally into outline format. But not that it's a real necessity, I feel that as long as it's searchable plaintext, it's good enough.
</p>
<p>
To search them, I've got a <b><b>global keybinding</b></b>, which invokes Emacs with incremental search prompt against the directory with rendered <code>org</code> files, which lets me interact with them in a blink on my computer. On Android I'm using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.docsearch">DocSearch</a> indexer (sadly it's not incremental, and app is not open source, so I'm looking for alternative).
</p>
<p>
Finally, I've got a <a href="https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll">Recoll</a> indexer instance + web interface running on my VPS; so if necessary I can access and search annotations via the internet.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000002d">
<p>
While reading, I often encounter something I want to google or check or read about later; or just come up to something actionable inspired by what I'm reading.
But I also don't want to interrupt from reading and losing context: that especially matters while reading on a E-ink device: distracting from the book, fetching your phone etc is really annoying.
</p>
<p>
So, as a workaround, I have programmed rules that pick out notes that start with "TODO" or marked with "TODO" tags; etc, and they are <b><b>automatically added to my agenda</b></b>. Later, when I see it on agenda, I'd assign it a priority and reschedule/unschedule depending on importance.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger/blob/350e76000e34db49cf6b574041b98bd813040851/ip2org.py#L16">Here's</a> an example of me using using <code>my.instapaper</code> module for that.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000002e">
<p>
It's kind of an extension of the previous use case: again, often you want to send something straight into your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> queue without having to remember to add that.
</p>
<p>
I've got two rules for that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if something is annotated with a certain marker ('drill' for me, comes from <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html">org-drill</a> package name)</li>
<li>if it's only got one word highlighted, which is useful for memorizing foreign words</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/orger/blob/350e76000e34db49cf6b574041b98bd813040851/krill.py#L13">Here's</a> how I'm using it for Kobo highlights.

<h3 id="org000002f"><a class="headerlink" href="#org000002f">¶</a>Life log</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000002f">
<p>
I'm a big fan of <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#lifelogging">#lifelogging</a> and all the timestamped highlights, comments and <a href="#org000001e">reading progress</a> from Kobo are an effortless (no manual logging!) contribution to my personal timeline, which I render and sync on my devices every few hours.
</p>
<p>
I sometimes use it when conversation with other people comes to awkward silence, so I can recall something I was reading recently and spark off an interesting (well at least for me) topic.

I'd be interested to know what do you think, and how are you managing your annotations or if you need some help with your existing workflow. Please also let me know if I missed any tools or features!

    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p>
So, what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">personal knowledge management</a>? TLDR, it's a name for the process of organizing your tasks, thoughts, information you know, so a fairly useful concept.
</p>
<p>
I guess almost everyone at least at some point of their life tried to bring more organization: used a calendar, checklists, notebook etc.
Perhaps you also were learning something and were wondering of more efficient ways of memorizing, organizing and acting on that information.
</p>
<p>
This is what I'm loosely going to refer as PKM further on.
</p>
<p>
Some of the reasons what I'm going to write about might be useful to you:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you generally want to be more organized in your life but not sure how</li>
<li>you are reading lots of stuff, but then you feel like you quickly forget it (especially on the Internet, where information is denser than in books)</li>
<li>you think that flesh is weak and want to offload remembering things to external persistent medium</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm writing that because my 'system' has more or less settled and stabilized, and I feel that I could be useful by helping out other people and sharing the ideas.
</p>
<p>
At this point, it also starts getting hard to keep up with all the things and hacks I implemented and maintaining let alone improving them, so I need to spread my ideas to the community.
</p>
<p>
A bit of disclaimer: some of the things I am doing may seem excessive and tedious – but you don't have to use exactly the same setup, I'm merely sharing for you something to kick off!
My own setup has been molded throughout the years with many influences from different people (who I will try to credit as long as I recall). Often some things I'm trying seem like too much effort even for me, but if you never overshoot, you might never hit that sweet spot between efficiency and convenience.
</p>
<p>
I'm very happy to discuss if you have any questions/suggestions/etc.
</p>
<style>
/* TODO err... what if it's got less than 2 digits?... so far only matters for pkm-plan post */
.section-number-2 {
    display: inline-block;
    text-align: right;

So, this is the plan, which I will fill with links as I write.

    <h1>Don't shoot the artist</h1>
    <div class="summary">How I visited a contemporary art museum and didn't get it</h2>
    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p>
Today I visited <a href="https://www.ludwigmuseum.hu/en">Ludwig Museum</a> in Budapest, which hosts a contemporary art gallery.
</p>
<p>
I don't think I generally 'get' contemporary art. However I don't get conventional either! I'm quite an unsophisticated person, some of art I like and appretiate, some don't. So I'm usually trying to expose myself to it just to keep up.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, by the time I got to the third floor of the exhibition I started to get irritated. Usually, I can appreciate at least some of art objects, but none of the ones I had seen so far made any sense. 
</p>
<p>
Some irritation was directed internally: "Ugh why am I doing this to myself, I should have gotten a coffee, sat on grass and enjoyed reading Penrose instead". But also a bit at the artists: "Ok, it's 2019, hasn't humanity seen enough white squares and various kinds of gradients?".
</p>
<p>
So as I walked among popart on the last floor my mind wandered and I remembered a post I read on <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/26/rule-genius-in-not-out/">SSC</a>. The idea that I had absorbed from it is that I shouldn't really judge people who are trying to come up with new ideas and things; they are already a minority and it's not worth wasting my mental resources as long as they are not harming anyone.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it's similar with art? They are exploring new territory, new mediums, so they are quite likely to make mistakes, such as things very few people get, if not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shard">hated by many</a>.
But the 1% that does manage to push the boundary would result in something beautiful that no one else would otherwise make (I'm sure you fancy at least some contemporary <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/2014-archdaily-building-of-the-year-awards_n_4645591">buildings</a> or <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern">art works</a> unless you were born in 1830). 
</p>
<p>
Not sure what happens to the remaining 99%. Maybe they give up on trying to invent new art and just become decent designers/architects? Would be interesting to check if that's actually the case.
</p>
<p>
This realization made the irritation go and made the rest of exploration a bit more pleasurable.

    <h1>sufs</h1>
    <div class="summary">Tool to merge directories via symlinks</h2>
    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/sufs">sufs</a> is a tool for ‘merging’ multiple directories into one via symlinks.</p>
<p>I’m syncing most of my stuff via syncthing, but some of it has to be locally (mainly for stupid reasons like massive <code>node_modules</code> directory etc.). But it’s nice to have a unified view of them so you don’t have to memorize what did you put where.</p>
<p>Usage example:</p>
<pre><code>   # initialize merged dir`
   mkdir /home/user/datas 

   # you might want to keep the following in cron
   sufs.py --to /home/user/datas /home/user/syncthing/data /home/user/dropbox/data /home/user/syncthing/data</code></pre>
<p>Before I wrote this script I tried FUSE based filesystems: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS">Unionfs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs">Mergerfs</a>, but wasn’t really satisfied. Weirdly, couldn’t also find anythig existing on github, so had to write my own.</p>
<p>First, you don’t know where actually fuse mounted dirst reside. Second, for instance, mergerfs had some weird new file handling logic, so the directories would end up scattered across multiple sources. Overall I found it a bit confusing.</p>
<p>This script uses symlinks, so you always know the actual location; and also maintains the top level directory as read only, so you can’t end up with dangling directories.</p>
<p>The only disadvantage at the moment is that symlink updating can only happen once a minute if you run via cron, but should be easy to use inotify if that’s an issue.</p>

    <h1>On cognitive demand of recycling</h1>
    <div class="summary">So many questions, so few answers</h2>
    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p>Even since I moved to the UK I’ve of course been separating waste. I wasn’t ever questioning the positive value of recycling or suspecting it could be a conspiracy designed to drain my time or anything along that line. In many ways it’s even easier since you can pile up plastic/cardboard/glass and just throw it away in bulk, and have a smaller food waste bin. I was never too crazy about it though, so I never bothered recycling every last bit of material that I possibly could.</p>
<p>Recently though I started wondering if I should be more efficient at recycling, so I googled for a bit, and … got nowhere.</p>
<p>For instance, one of my fluorescent light bulbs died. It’s not recycled by the council, so can’t be put in the recycling dumpster. Apparently it also contains mercury and shouldn’t be put in general waste either. The closest recycling facility that accepts energy efficient bulbs is 15 mins from me by tube. The question is — disregarding that I don’t feel like spending half an hour in transport to recycle couple of light bulbs: is it more efficient for the planet if instead of going there I just spend that time on my high paying job and donate the money. I seriously suspect that recycling a bulb is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">not the most environmentally efficient thing I can do with my skills</a>. <strong>How much environmental impact in terms of pure dollars of damage does a light bulb have anyway?</strong> Sadly, I didn’t manage to find any specific numbers.</p>
<p>Another thing that puzzled me: <strong>is it worth washing a soiled plastic container before recycling?</strong> You’re wasting hot water and detergents after all, which also has some environmental impact (also your time if you wash manually). The internet gives confusing answers, starting from people who put their greasy plastic in dishwasher to suggestions to only give a quick rinse. I can’t understand how rinsing without washing helps against attracting bacteria and greasing paper in mixed recycling. Couldn’t google anything meaningful either.</p>
<p>Interesting enough, while looking that up, I ran into many discussions of using paper plates vs washing ceramic plates — apparently it’s unclear which is more environmental! <a href="https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/6020">Here’s</a> an example calculation which gives <code>$0.78</code> vs <code>$0.63</code>, the difference I find pretty marginal. Generally all over the place the answer seems to be “it depends on your detergent, electricity source, etc”. <strong>How is an average person meant to figure that out?</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it’s not even clear which <a href="https://www.pureplanetrecycling.co.uk/types-of-plastics/">types of plastic</a> materials you can recycle. For instance, my <a href="https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/environment_and_waste/recycling_and_waste/a-z_recycling_guide.aspx">council’s website</a> has no mention of specific materials whatsoever, only ‘trays’, ‘yogurt pots’ and ‘bags’.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/environment-and-planning/waste-and-recycling/household-waste-and-recycling/Pages/recycling-A-to-Z.aspx">City of London website</a> confuses me as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>It mentions PS (polystyrene, 6) as non-recyclable and it instructs to recycle yogurt pots. However some of yogurt pots are made of polystyrene!</li>
<li>“Plastic bags, including those used for salad, bread, rice/pasta should be placed in the household waste”. While most of salad packaging I seen here has no marking, some of it is made of PP (polypropylene, 5), which is same stuff that used to make yogurt pots. <strong>Surely there should be no difference in recycling as long as it’s the same material?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I find it very hard to remember every specific shape of plastic, surely it’s way easier to base your decision to recycle on a single number they but on plastic? At least there is a little I can do about that and I emailed my council asking to clarify.</p>
<p>Lastly, I can’t help feeling that I’m nitpicking and the 95% of obviously recyclable stuff I already recycle is enough; and that I should have spent time writing this post doing something more obviously useful. However, I’m already done and hopefully will gain more knowledge about recycling as a result.</p>
<p><strong>How can we make it easier to decide if something can or can’t be recycled and whether it has net positive cost with respect to time you spend doing it?</strong></p>
<p>If you know answers to any of the questions here, please let me know!</p>

<p>If you are working with numerical computations in an IPython notebook, you don't really have much choice but accompany your computations by Latex
formulas. However, with symbolic computations, you can massively save on repeating the same formulas which are already encoded in your
symbolic object. Here's a quick example how it typically looks in the notebooks I've seen on the internet:</p>

<p>What I don't like about that style of presentation is that it's pretty scattered and reqires interleaving displayed formulas with random python cells.
That's bad since it either pollutes your notebook and takes up vertical space, or discourages you from producing useful outputs in favor of notebook aethetics. Here are couple of examples <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">featured on Sympy</a> website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1072&amp;context=physsp/">Quantum Programming in Python</a>, suffers from the first problem</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bjodah/chempy/blob/d5371c7/examples/ammonical_cupric_solution.ipynb">chempy</a> suffers from the second problem</li>
</ul>
<p>What we want is to output whole bunch of things at once.
Sadly, <code>display</code> doesn't support even outputting two formulas on a single line without hacking CSS,
so this is the easiest way of doing it I came up with to so far:</p>

<p>So far so good, I just define <code>ldisplay = ldisplay_md</code> on top of my notebook and use <code>ldisplay</code> instead of display for singleline outputs.</p>
<p>However while trying to use it with <a href="https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook">EIN</a> (emacs frontent for jupiter),
I ran into an issue: EIN doesn't support Markdown outputs!
Same thing happens if you run it in terminal: you're just gonna get <code>&lt;IPython.core.display.Markdown object&gt;</code>.
Nevertheless, it is capable of outputing formulas as ASCII art, kinda like this:</p>

<pre><code>                2
∂              ∂
──(U(x, t)) = ───(U(x, t))
∂t              2
              ∂x

</code></pre>
<p>, so we can achieve a similar effect by formatting manually via <code>str.format</code>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here's the bit of code which does that:</p>

<p>The sad thing is that figuring out the <code>as_text</code> bit took me about an hour of intense debugging, 
including setting explicit pdb breakpoints in IPython source code. I'm not sure how normal people are meant to figure that out. 
One could argue that desire to work with IPython notebooks in Emacs is not very normal either though.
Hopefully that saves someone else a bit of time.</p>

    <h1>I've found Google Takeouts to silently remove old data</h1>
    <div class="summary">Crosspost from /r/DataHoarder</h2>

    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p>This is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ayt5cu/ive_found_out_google_takeout_archives_are_not/">crosspost</a> from Reddit.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: keep/backup your old Google Takeout archives, turns out the data is not persisted across them.</p>
<p>So I am working on a personal project for which I am collecting all the URLs I even visited. I update them via cron from multiple sources, in particular my latest Google Takeout archive which I’m always storing on my desktop. I’ve been improving the resilience of the project in terms of making sure I don’t break URL extracion so I wrote a script to diff the extracted urls and check if any of them disappear. What I found out was that urls from takeout were in fact mysteriously disappearing.</p>
<p>After a bit of WTF and investigation, turned out that takeout data is not cumulative (at least for some of sources), and seems to have some sort of retention period.</p>
<p>Here are some of my findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>archive from 20181227</p>

<p>that takeout doesn’t have any of MyActivity.html (Google added it later in 2017) there is <code>Searches</code> directory which contains some jsons back to October 2010</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary: looks like <code>BrowserHistory.json</code> has got a retention of about 1 year, same for <code>Chrome/MyActivity.html</code>. <code>Search/MyActivity.html</code> has got a retention of about 3 years. It’s a mess.</p>
<p>Not sure if there is a similar issue with other takeout stuff (e.g. youtube watch history, shopping, location etc), so be careful if you rely on it!</p>
<p>I guess it was sort of a gut feeling that I was paranoid about that and was keeping some of the older archives.</p>
<p>Also I haven’t really found anything about this retention anywhere in google takeout FAQ. Does anyone know about it? Is it some sort of legal requirement, a bug or something else?</p>

    <h1>Quantifying quantified-mind.com</h1>
    <div class="summary">Exploiting javascript to reverse engineer cognitive score</h2>
    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p><a href="http://www.quantified-mind.com/about">Quantified Mind</a> is a website which provides a handful of cognitive tests. It lets you choose a bunch of tests and you can run them whenever you wish, adding quantitative variables you are measuring alongside (e.g. hours of sleep, or cups of coffee you drank) or just arbitrary notes. <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/QM_collage.jpg">Here</a> is how it looks like.</p>
<p>Why is it interesting? If you are like me and don’t feel much obvious subjective effects of conventional stimulants, sleep or exercise, it would be great to have some objective measure in case the effects are subtle but present. For you it could be saving half an hour of sleep per night by using melatonin, or realizing coffee doesn’t have effect on your cognitive performance, or something else.</p>
<p>That sounded pretty interesting to me, and I started doing some tests (simple reaction time, visual matching, sorting and 1-back). However, given that effects are subtle in the first place, I wasn’t expecting to get any insights by gazing at collected data, so I needed to make sure I can export my experiments to run some sort of regression on them later.</p>
<p>To my disappointment, when I ran thirty or something sessions and downloaded the CSV, it didn’t have error rate/reaction time, but you are only getting some magical ‘score’. It was unclear what it meant from the FAQ so I emailed the authors and got a response:</p>
<pre><code>As for scores - it's a calculation that involves everything in a test, so for simple reaction time it involves both reaction times
and accuracy. 
The actual formulas aren't available, but the instructions are always simple: go for accuracy first, and try to be as fast as you can
without sacrificing accuracy.</code></pre>
<p>“Formulas aren’t available” was quite unsatisfactory to me. What are they actually measuring? So before carrying on and doing more tests I tried to reverse engineer the model.</p>
<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<p>The idea was simple: choose couple of tests that are easy to automate. Luckily, the website is not using flash and not very heavy on javascript or obfuscation, so interacting with elements via javascript was fairly easy. In essence, I’m varying average reaction time (delay) and number of errors (which I make deliberately in the script), and inject the script into chrome via Selenium. Then I record the scores for further analysis.</p>
<p>If you wanna experiment by yourself, <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/qm-reverse-engineering">here’s</a> the repository and if you don’t feel like running the scripts for a day to collect data, I uploaded it to <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/qm-reverse-engineering/releases">releases</a>.</p>
<h1 id="tests">Tests</h1>
<p>I’ve chosen “Simple reaction time” and “Visual matching”. From the <a href="http://www.quantified-mind.com/science">“science”</a> section:</p>
<pre><code>The first is “Simple Reaction Time,” which assesses how quickly a person can respond to a single stimulus (a circle that turns 
from white to green) by pressing the space bar. 

“Visual Matching” places two highlighted grids next to one another and asks a person to judge, as quickly as possible, whether 
the two grids are identical.</code></pre>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>TLDR: I find the models pretty weird.</p>
<p>Here is the demo of my script that extracted scores from the tests: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dolS7X7QrB0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here is what I got after the simulations (clicking highly recommended):</p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/291333/53916603-6a875880-405a-11e9-9447-90da86bf959a.png"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/291333/53916603-6a875880-405a-11e9-9447-90da86bf959a.png" width="auto" /> </a></p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/291333/53916604-6a875880-405a-11e9-824a-ab2445cc4184.png"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/291333/53916604-6a875880-405a-11e9-824a-ab2445cc4184.png" width="auto" /> </a></p>
<h1 id="observations">Observations</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Same score could mean different things; you can see it from the plots if you draw horizontal lines, they would intersect multiple curves corresponding to different delays.</p>
<p>So, for instance, if you get score 600 on visual matching, that could mean that you did the test with 880ms reaction and 0 errors, or with 840ms reaction and 2 errors or 760ms reaction and 4 errors. These are fairly different results and even though it’s good to have some sort of aggregate score, it’s also useful to distinguish. E.g. maybe caffeine makes you less patient so you press early and make more errors.</p></li>
<li><p>For low reaction time (&lt;300ms for simple reaction time &lt;600ms for visual matching), the plots don’t look continuous, there are some sudden drops. That’s pretty suspicious IMO.</p>
<p>Perhaps that could explained by the fact that such low times are impossible to get by average humans and they are out of the test domain.</p></li>
<li><p>If you keep number of error fixed, one would expect that score grows as the reaction time goes does. That is not the case on plots, probably related to the artifact above.</p></li>
<li><p>If you keep reaction time fixed, you would expect the score to decrease monotonically with the number of errors. You can see that for simple reaction time after 600ms, the score actually monotonically <strong>increases</strong> as you make more errors. Again, one could argue that reaction of 600 ms is too long for average human on this test (e.g. I score about 230), but I can easily imagine drugs (even such as alcohol) resulting in these scores, which could also be interesting to measure.</p></li>
<li><p>If you think about, 8 (out of 16) errors is what you would get on visual matching if you answer randomly (which you could do with almost arbitrary low reaction time). So if you do that, say, with 400ms delay, according to the plot you would score around 620 points. Which is what I get by doing the test myself with 800ms reaction and making 1 error. So what does the score represent then?</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>I can’t see how is that score meaningful and I’m glad I didn’t spend more time doing these tests. Perhaps one is better off measuring reaction time directly instead of some mystical ‘score’.</p>
<h1 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h1>
<p>Could be interesting to do similar reverse engineering on other cognitive testing platforms.</p>

    <h1>Sleep tracking</h1>
    <div class="summary">How not to do it</h2>
    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p>I’ve been tracking my sleep passively for a while. Not that I had any issues with sleep, but considering you spend massive chunk of your life sleeping, seems like a good idea to optimize it. After I bought <a href="https://www.emfit.com/sleep-sensing-solutions-with-hrv">Emfit</a> sleep tracker I figured it would be interesting to try correlating its stats with my subjective feelings.</p>
<p>Every morning, I log few things on the scale from 0 (bad) to 2 (good), one of which is something that I defined as “physical energy” (as opposed to mental energy). Well,</p>

<p>As you can see that’s not very fruitful (not sure what happened on 13 July 2018 lol). There are two possibilities here: my self introspection is really bad: many well being/mood tracking apps would let people estimate on the scale from 1 to 10, and I can’t even distinguish between three states.</p>
<p>Another one is that I’m just very stable and actually have no variation. For instance, I never had problems working out first thing in the morning, without having any food or stimulants. What bothers me a bit is that I don’t seem to experience any ‘high energy’ states either, which apparently people do.</p>
<p>I guess the lesson here is to reevaluate things I’m measuring after a short while and make sure I can actually track something meaningful or something I am capable of measuring.</p>

    <h1>Grasp</h1>
    <div class="summary">How to capture information from your browser and stay sane</h2>
    </section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section class="content">
    <p>This is not the post I was gonna start writing with. It was supposed to be something a bit more abstract and pure, but oh well.</p>
<p>Trigger warning: if you are a kind of person that doesn’t care about their browser bookmarks at all and happily loses them after switching to new computer, you might be shocked and perhaps repulsed by the level of elaboration I’m taking up here. Please sit tight, breathe and remember that I don’t judge you!</p>
<p>So, let’s talk about browser bookmarks.</p>
<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<p>I’ve always loved my bookmarks and been keeping, rereading and moving them around since high school. I also tend to be very organized in terms of meta information, so every bookmark would eventually end up in a category/folder. Of course there are obstacles.</p>
<p>First of all, Chromium bookmark adding menu was a bit shit and <a href="http://www.rawinfopages.com/tips/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chrome-bookmarks1.png">still</a> is. You get to choose among the five most recently used folders only; if you want anything specific, you have to click all the way through (Tab with my 100+ folders was just not doable). You can’t search when you add bookmark either. Yes, I know, it’s not meant for geeks, it’s for normal people who love mouseclicks. I’m still puzzled by how people who develop that stuff use their own product though.</p>
<p>These days Chrome has got <code>chrome.bookmarks</code> api, which I’d imagine allows you to implement your own bookmark manager. Back in 2012, it didn’t exist though.</p>
<p>I was a bit less fussy back then so I was kind of okay with that. Until one day the disaster appended. I realized I couldn’t decide which folder did the bookmark belong to. That was pretty disturbing, so I started looking for alternatives. I realized I needed something like tags and turned out Firefox had that feature for ages. So I switched the browser.</p>
<p>Firefox was noticeably slower and greedier in terms of RAM (no Rust in Firefox in 2012!). And few months later I got my first Android phone and realized that Firefox didn’t support syncing tags with Android (it still <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=775672">doesn’t</a>).</p>
<p>Until I found out about <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>! If you wanna borrow one thing from this post, please try and use that, it’s really awesome. It has solved almost all of my issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can easily add new bookmarks, tag them and it would be synced across all your browsers and devices</li>
<li>you can mark them private and public, and search in other people’s bookmarks</li>
<li>what is more, you can add notes for some context about your bookmarks!</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve had few happy years with Pinboard. Until I started getting more serious about information processing and my knowledge management. I’ll tell about that one day, but long story short, I found out that I spend a lot of time moving bookmarks scattered across pinboard into my personal plaintext wiki to give it a bit more structure, fulltext search and easier access. I’ve also started using Org mode and in particular, <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-Refile-Archive.html#Capture-Refile-Archive">capture and refile</a>. Once you are used to that, moving information manually by copy-pasting is just plain torture. You know, life is too short for that shit.</p>
<h1 id="eh-capture-refile">Eh? Capture? Refile?</h1>
<p>It’s hard to explain, for me it took several iterations to adopt these. In essence, you can ‘capture’, that is, copy/create piece of information like a url, quote, your thought or anything else and store in a text file for further processing which you can do it later. It’s meant to be with as little interruptions as possible, merely to persist the information. Typically, in emacs it’s a matter of pressing a keystroke, making you note and pressing a keystroke to finalize. You can do it as fast as you think/type and then immediately get back to what you were working on.</p>
<p>You can look up quite a few different setups online: <a href="https://youtu.be/fgizHHd7nOo?t=207">typical demo (till 4:10)</a>. The concept doesn’t really have to be restricted to org mode, though. Funny enough, before I ran into org-capture, I had a keybinding to open Vim in the insert mode against my <code>notes.txt</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="it-sounds-really-abstract.">It sounds really abstract.</h2>
<p>Sure. Let me be a bit more specific. My typical scenario is doing some research in the broad sense, e.g. shopping or looking for a property to rent or learning.</p>
<p>Imagine you’ve got a bit of time during your lunch break at work and want to spend it learning some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory">representation theory</a>. For me (and I’d imagine for many people), it makes little sense doing that just for 20 minutes, your mind is diffused, and you need time to gain back some context before doing productive learning.</p>
<p>But you could at least skim through some articles and highlight things to think about later when you got more time which you can dedicate solely for learning. So you read through the different articles and blog posts, and you want to highlight things and potentially add todo items for further googling/thinking. You don’t have time to think about them now, you just want to make sure you think about them later, e.g. see <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/291333/51799721-a984eb80-221c-11e9-9612-8eb7f553dc01.png">screenshot</a>.</p>
<p>So you go through the article and annotate it/add points to think on. You want to do it as fast as you can read without distracting on copy-pasting the information and trying to organize it. Later, when you got time, you just search everything marked with the tag <code>reprtheory</code> and in your <code>capture.org</code> file you find an entry like that:</p>
<pre><code>* [2019-02-09 Sat 14:54] Special unitary group - Wikipedia   :reprtheory:physics:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group
Selection:
here is a 2:1 homomorphism from SU(2) to SO(3).
Comment:
Why do they always mention that? Is that important?</code></pre>
<p>, which you can further action on. Perhaps you’ve figured it out already, so you can just discard it. Or you want to convert it into a TODO, give it a priority and refile somewhere more appropriate. What’s awesome is that at the time of capture it immediately becomes searchable and indexable as any plaintext would without any extra effort (unlike if you added it to browser bookmarks/pinboard).</p>
<h1 id="ok-im-sold.-how-do-i-do-it">Ok, I’m sold. How do I do it?</h1>
<p>So, you want to integrate your browser with your knowledge repository and capture things straight into your <code>capture.org</code> file. Sounds trivial, right?</p>
<p>For a while I used <a href="https://github.com/sprig/org-capture-extension">org-capture extension</a>, that was relying on setting up a special mime type handler (e.g. <code>emacs://</code>) and an always running emacs daemon. Until one day I got very sad when few days of captured link and selected text were gone because one of these things stopped working for some reason. People seem to have issues setting up all this to work, and of course, you can’t have feedback from OS mime handler, so you can never know whether it has succeeded at all.</p>
<p>I realized I didn’t want to rely on emacs running all the time, on its templates or anything like that. I just want to reliably append stuff (formatted as org-mode) to the text file, that’s not too much to ask. An obvious solution is to get rid of the mime type handler and just write to the file system from Chrome extension directly. This is, of course something you can’t do in modern browsers. There is an <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_storage#write">API</a> in Chrome for that, and you’ve got two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>write a file to a sandbox within a browser. Not an option for my purposes.</li>
<li>select a path via ‘save as’ GUI dialog and write it. Disgusting, <em>definitely</em> not an option.</li>
</ul>
<p>So after a while I realized something else has to write to the file. And that something else could be a local http server. The extension sends the request, the local backend writes the entry and responds with success/error, which can be passed onto UI notification, so you will always know if something failed. After a bit of coding, <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/grasp">Grasp</a> was born.</p>
<h1 id="what-makes-grasp-better">What makes Grasp better?</h1>
<p>Quite a few things actually!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it’s reliable and you will get an error notification if you failed to capture</p></li>
<li><p>it supports capturing selected text, adding comment and tags</p></li>
<li><p>you can capture anywhere: it doesn’t care whether you have emacs installed at all, and doesn’t have to be org mode file</p></li>
<li><p>unlike <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/capture-protocol.html">org-protocol</a> which only supports url, title and ‘everything else’, the capture template syntax can be extended to include anything you want, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/grasp/blob/247dd5856d34d05f4c2239f34a5d2904d0961326/server/org_tools.py#L91">currently</a> it also supports <code>tags</code>, <code>comment</code> and <code>selection</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>it can run anywhere, e.g. you can run it the server on your VPS and access remotely if you are browsing on a computer you can’t sync your capture file onto.</p>
<p>I might even try and see if it can be ported as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/android/">Android Firefox addon</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="implementing">Implementing</h1>
<p>Few random things I learnt while implementing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://flow.org">flow</a> and <a href="https://eslint.org/">eslint</a> are good</p>
<p>Trivial to integrate and they make the dreaded JS programming pretty manageable and akin to Python.</p>
<p>Turns out Flow even it supports <a href="https://flow.org/en/docs/types/comments/">comment types</a>, kinda like <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#type-comments">python/mypy</a>. That must be very beneficial for people trying to integrate it. Just imagine that you can slowly convert your whole codebase into type safe code before your coworkers realize what’s happened!</p></li>
<li><p>Webpack is good</p>
<p>Used it mainly to strip off Flow annotations and convert code into something chrome would accept. However it’s also helpful for merging the extension manifest so you could build browser-specific versions.</p></li>
<li><p>fun fact: <code>node_modules</code> takes almost 200Mb of disk space, and I tried my best to use as less dependencies as possible. Almost all are dev dependencies, so the extension itself is still tiny.</p></li>
<li><p>Firefox and Chrome use more or less same browser APIs these days! The only thing I had to fix while porting to Firefox were notifications.</p></li>
<li>publishing to Chrome store is more tedious than I imagined, e.g.
<ul>
<li>they want screenshots exactly 1280x800 or 640x400. Do people have some sort of scripts to cut their screenshots automatically for them or what?</li>
<li>there are two interfaces (‘old’ and ‘new’), which are sometimes doing different things</li>
<li>it’s generally pretty flaky, sometimes when you update the extension, old meta about your extension disappears and you have to copy it manually. I find it pretty mean to developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess I should just use the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/using_webstore_api">API</a> for publishing.</p></li>
<li><p>publishing to <a href>addons.mozilla.org</a> is super fast and easy</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/grasp/issues/7">firefox hotkeys are not configurable</a></p>
<p>I still find it very hard to believe. Has it always been like that? How do people cope with it?</p></li>
<li><p>CI is a bit tedious</p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/grasp/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml">My pretty minimal config</a>, is quite long. I’m quite used to to CIs, but I wonder how often are people discouraged by that, it’s got to be easier. Perhaps <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/">Auto DevOps</a> from gitlab solves it?</li>
<li><p>communicating with <code>localhost</code> made everything so much simpler. I’ve already converted another <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/were-you-here">thing</a> I am working on to use that instead of trying to utilize local storage/internal database and it works flawlessly!</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="feedback">Feedback</h1>
<p>I actually think it’s the first thing I solely implemented and prepared something and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/akazos/orggrasp_browser_extension_for_orgcapture/">shared</a> for other people to use. As expected, it actually took more time than sketching a prototype that worked for me. But it feels so great when people DM you on reddit and say that they managed to run it even on Windows without any issues when no other existing methods could do that.</p>
<h1 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h1>
<p>I’m gonna look up what are Markdown people using for capturing information, add few templates and spread the good stuff. I’m excited!</p>
