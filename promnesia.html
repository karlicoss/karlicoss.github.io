<b>Draft stage</b>: mostly ready in terms of structure?
Needs polishing and spell/grammar check? Not sure if it should be split into several pages?
And there is also more stuff I'd like to write, but it's already long enough…
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promneisa">Promnesia</a> is a browser extension (Chrome/Firefox/Firefox mobile) which serves as a web surfing copilot,
enhancing your browsing history, improving the web exploration experience and integrating it with your knowledge base.
</p>
<p>
The repository contains some demos and the setup guide, this post is more of a motivation and the story of what has led me to work on it.
</p>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0000000"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000000">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">1</span> I want my singularity!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I've been raised on science fiction, and growing up, I've been dreaming about the technology drastically changing our lives.
Artificial intelligence, augmenting the brain with a math coprocessor, neural interfaces, having perfect reaction and memory – many of you are on the same page and know the drill.
</p>
<p>
Years had passed, I became a software engineer and had realised how far are we from all these fancy technologies I wanted.
So my <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: dreams? ambitions? need a better word</span> have become more modest, and I've chosen a more realistic and plausible target:
using my digital trace like browser history, webpage annotations and my <a href="./tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a> to make up for the limited memory.
</p>
<p>
I'm exploring lots of information on the Internet, and it feels wasteful to use my meat resources <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: tag?</span> to keep track of it.
Web browsers tracks it automatically, without any manual and conscious effort.
</p>
<p>
Surely we can benefit from the immense computing and memory capabilities of the computer?
</p>
<p>
So I figured that I wanted:
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="what_i_want"><a class="headerlink" href="#what_i_want">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Ok, maybe a web assistant at least?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what_i_want">
<p>
A web surfing companion. A copilot.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>.
A <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html">Remembrance Agent</a>?
Call it whatever you like, I <i>wish</i> it was a concept with a widely accepted name.
</p>
<p>
Something that would:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
aid me with <b>information processing</b>
</p>
<p>
Keep track of what I've read, when, on what device, and for how long.
</p></li>
<li><p>
show me my <b>annotations and highlights</b>, within the original page
</p>
<p>
I don't want to keep wondering whether I got my throughts stashed in some app. (TODO)
</p></li>
<li><p>
unify my <b>scattered and siloed bookmarks</b>
</p>
<p>
Firefox bookmarks; Reddit/Hackernews saves; "Watch later" on Youtube, saved links in your instant messenger.
</p>
<p>
These are the same damn thing, yet there is no way to oversee and process them through a single interface.
<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  JB something about 'universal queue'?</span>
</p></li>
<li><p>
connect with my online presence: chats and social networks
</p>
<p>
If I've tweeted about a page, surely this fact should be present in the history.
In fact, it's <b>way</b> more important than a simple browser visit.
</p></li>
<li><p>
help me to explore new information and <b>prioritize</b> it
</p>
<p>
There is so much awesome stuff on the Internet! The biggest problem I have is picking the next cool link to dig into.
</p>
<p>
I wish there was something that could <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  with a single click?</span> show me, who of my friends, or of the people I follow, have read a certain link.
What did they think? Have they posted about it, annotated or something else? Do they follow the author?
</p></li>
<li><p>
bridge the gap between the browser and my private wiki
</p>
<p>
TODO elaborate? not sure if many people understand what's a private wiki
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I wanted a system like this <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/767412935316611072">for</a> several <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/896313846159298560">years</a>.
</p>
<p>
At some point, after failed attempts at finding an existing solution (TODO link), I'd figured that it was going to be a yet another thing I had to implement myself.
</p>
<p>
The journey to build this took longer than I expected, led me theought a rabbithole and lots of yak shaving,
and made me realize: <b>browser history is very, very broken</b>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="history_broken"><a class="headerlink" href="#history_broken">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Browser history is broken</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-history_broken">
<p>
Web browser history is a rich source of potentially useful information.
Just think about it: it's zero effort <a href="./tags.html#lifelogging">lifelogging</a>.
It contains exact timestamps and links which <i>basically</i> address information.
</p>
<p>
To some extent, URLs express relationships like persons/groups/TODO?? we have for free.
Seems like a <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: rich/ripe ??? for ???</span>, right?
You should be able to know TODO, associate TODO, and be able to easily trace your jumps through the websites.
</p>
<p>
Now think what experience do you have instead. What was the last time you used it in any nontrivial way, for something other than reopening an accidentally closed tab?
</p>
<p>
In addition <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: reword?</span>:

<h3 id="org0000001"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000001">¶</a>it's not just about web browsers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
If you're using a native phone app (say, for Reddit or Twitter), you history either isn't logged anywhere or stored locally on your phone.

</span><aside class="sidenote">this is why I emphasise <b>browsing</b> history, not <b>browser</b> history</aside></div>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
On Android, it's likely to be in an Sqlite database in <code class="inline">/data/data/app.name</code>.
This directory is not accessible to normal users, <b>unless your phone is rooted</b>.
Just think about how ridiculous it is. It's <b>your own data</b>, yet your OS babysits you and prevents your from accessing it.

</span><aside class="sidenote">rooting Android phones ranges from "<b>somewhat</b> painful" to "<b>very</b> painful"</aside></div>
<p>
As a specific example, <a href="https://github.com/ccrama/Slide">Reddit Slide</a> app keeps the view history in <samp class="inline">/data/data/me.ccrama.redditslide/SEEN</samp>.
Even if you root your phone and can access the database, because <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  model is flawed something something</span>
the app isn't persisting the data in the database, it's merely a cache TODO latest few weeks or something?
So if you want your complete history, you have to backup this database regularly, keep the snapshots and <a href="exports.html#synthetic">somehow</a>
reconstruct it.
</p>
<p>
You may dismiss this as data nitpicking, but when <b>all</b> of your phone apps are doing this, you're missing out on quite a lot of information.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0000002"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000002">¶</a>it's scattered and siloed</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Continuing the previous point:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for the most part, you can't access history in your phone apps</li>
<li><p>
lots of data which is <i>ought</i> to be counted as web history is scattered across silos
</p>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
It sits behind the APIs (best case), GDPR and manual exports (worst case)
and hard to get hands on <i>even</i> if you're an experienced software engineer.

</span><aside class="sidenote"><a href="sad-infra.html">#sadinfra</a></aside></div>
<p>
It idles on your filesystem in markdown and org-mode files.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Even <i>regular</i> browser history is not easy to get hands on:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1080942">used to</a> silently 'expire' your browser history</li>
<li><p>
Chrome deletes history older than <a href="https://superuser.com/a/364475/300795">90 days</a>
</p>
<p>
The only way to access older history I'm aware of is <a href="https://myactivity.google.com">Google Activity</a> and Takeout.
</p></li>
<li>Google Takeout <a href="./takeout-data-gone.html">quietly recycles your history</a></li>
<li><p>
Migration is limited to the most popular browsers
</p>
<p>
The retention limits the migration as well.
E.g. if you migrate from Chrome to Firefox, the history older than 90 days is locked and siloed in your Google Account.
</p></li>
<li><p>
You're gonna have hard time if you're not using Google/Mozilla sync
</p>
<p>
Your history will be scattered across devices and lost on OS reinstalls.
</p>
<p>
There are ways of selfhosting Firefox sync, and (<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/614744/how-to-set-up-a-own-chrome-sync-server">allegedly</a>) even Chrome sync,
but, as you can imagine, it's quite tedious.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0000003"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000003">¶</a>it's got different weight</h3>

Not all links in your history are equal (on equal/the same grounds??).

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>some are clicked on by accident</li>
<li>some you've just skimmed</li>
<li>some are on your reading list</li>

<li>some you are keeping in your knowledge base/personal wiki</li>
<li>some of them you've shared with other people on social media</li>

The current browser history experience makes absolutely no difference between these scenarios.

There is a family of Chrome extensions similar to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-trends-unlimited/pnmchffiealhkdloeffcdnbgdnedheme">History Trends Unlimited</a>,

The only problem they solve is the said retention, and it ends up as a yet another silo.

If anything, Memex is probably <b>the nicest silo</b> I know of. It keeps data locally, it's got data imports from other services.
</p>
<p>
But nevertheless, if you commit to using it, you have to move the data into Memex, and confom it to its model.
</p>
<p>
If for some reason you can't or don't want to use Memex for annotating and recording all of your history (e.g. on some of your devices) – you
TODO.
TODO see the point that "it's not about the browser"
</p>
<p>
TODO a nice tool is great, but what I want is a different <b>model</b> of interacting with my existing data, which doesn't require moving the data inbetween the silos.

<p>
Ok enough rants! <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promneisa">Promnesia</a> is the tool I've developed to address some of the issues with the browsing history I've mentioned.
</p>
<p>
I think I've already TODO explained, what I wanted, so I'll TODO recap?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
unify scattered and siloed browser history under a single interface
</p>
<p>
There should be absolutely no difference between the link you opened yesterday in your Instapaper phone app,
and a link you visited in Firefox ten years ago.
</p></li>
<li><p>
make it possible to trace through the history TODO to find out why and how you got on the page
</p>
<p>
Let me anwswer, when, how and why have I visited/bookmarked the page?
</p></li>
<li><p>
integrate the metadata: annotations, highlights, notes, chat messages, tweets, etc. Display it right within the page when applicable (highlights)
</p>
<p>
Make webpages context aware and connect with your TODO other digital?? walled gardens?
TODO release from silos?
</p></li>
<li>make the URLs useful, aware of the hierarchy and relations between TODO</li>
<li>make the history useful: TODO if you've already visited a page/domain/etc</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here, I'm cheating a little bit, because some of these goals weren't clear from the beginning – I had understodd them during the development.
</p>
<p>
There are also some meta-goals and principles I'm TODO adhering?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
make it open source
</p>
<p>
That goes without saying TODO.
</p></li>
<li><p>
local first
</p>
<p>
browser history is sensitive data and you should have control where do you keep it and how you're accessing it
</p>
<p>
In the simplest setup, promnesia talks to your browser through a local port and your data is not exposed TODO
</p></li>
<li><p>
make it flexible
</p>
<p>
As long as it's something you can extract URLs from, you should be able to feed it in Promnesia
</p></li>
<li><p>
make it TODO detangled, so it's possible to use components
</p>
<p>
I've been mostly removing/moving away the code from Promnesia.
</p></li>
<li><p>
don't build another silo, use existing information
</p>
<p>
This kind of complements the previous point.
</p>
<p>
There are many decent services and tools already. They all have their own pros and cons (TODO link to annotation post?)
Different people prefer different tools (TODO e.g. for annotation), sometimes because they're locked in (TODO silo link) and don't have much choice,
but sometimes because they genuinely have TODO tiny preferences etc, opinions etc?
</p>
<p>
Cost of switching in time and cognitive effort is too high.
There's always a risk that you'd encounter this one small thing that would make the tool a no-go.
</p>
<p>
We should invest into finding better ways of combinding them, not rewriting all over again.
</p>
<p>
Integrate them and provide the means of TODO between silos.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
TODO biggest topics/usecases?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
TODO Finding new information?
</p>
<p>
For example, I run into an <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/66/clockwork/haunted-by-his-brother-he-revolutionized-physics-rp">article</a> on Twitter. I enjoyed it, and the website looks kind of familiar.
</p>
<p>
When I jump on <a href="https://nautil.us">https://nautil.us</a>, the Promnesia sidebar shows me that I've visited and even annotated other articles on this site before!
</p>
<p>
So it seems worthy an RSS subscription, which I do!

<li>Exploring people and communities

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
How often have I engaged with this blog in the past?
</p>
<p>
Which posts have I already seen or read? Did I like them?
Should I dive deeper?
</p></li>
<li>Same questions, but for twitter accounts, subreddits, youtube channels or anything similar</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Processing large amounts of information
</p>
<p>
Somewhat similar to the

<li>post compilations (TODO example)

</ul></li>
<li><p>
Support annotations and highlights from <b>any</b> service (e.g. Instapaper/Pocket)
</p>
<p>
I want to make my annotations avail TODO inline, without having

TODO want to do what hypothes.is does but without necessarily using Hypothes.is

<li>Personal digital archeology and external memory

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why did I bookmark this youtube video? Who sent it to me?</li>
<li>How did I get on this forgotten tab?</li>
<li><p>
I'm sometimes annoyed by @&lt;account&gt;'s tweets. Should I unfollow them?
</p>
<p>
Why did I follow them in the first place? Are they worth following overall? Do I like their tweets often or bookmark their links?

<li>Integrating with your knowledge base</li>
<li>Tap into other's brains

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>TODO demo?</li>

<li><p>
TODO unified browser history
</p>
<p>
I'm listing it the last, because its benefits are apparent only when you TODO want one of the above
</p>
<p>
As you get more and more detailed history, the system becomes more useful.

I've always expected my computer <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  not necessarily computer</span> to be a rememberance system.
Promnesia is a step I've taken to bring that future closer.
