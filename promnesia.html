<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promneisa">Promnesia</a> is a browser extension (Chrome/Firefox/Firefox mobile) that serves as a web surfing copilot,
enhancing your browsing history, improving the web exploration experience, and integrating it with your knowledge base.

The repository contains some demos and the setup guide, this post is more of the motivation and the story of what has led me to work on it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-singularity_when">
<p>
I was raised on science fiction, and growing up, I've been dreaming about the technology drastically changing our lives.
Artificial intelligence, augmenting the brain with a math co-processor, head-up display, neural interfaces, having perfect reaction and memory – many of you are on the same page and know the drill.
</p>
<p>
Years had passed, I became a software engineer and had realized how far are we from all these fancy technologies I wanted.
So my <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: dreams? ambitions? need a better word</span> have become more modest, and I've chosen a more realistic and plausible target:
using my digital trace like browser history, webpage annotations and my <a href="./tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a> to make up for the limited memory.
</p>
<p>
I'm exploring lots of information on the Internet, and it feels wasteful to use my meat resources <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: tag?</span> to keep track of it.
Web browsers tracks it automatically, without any manual and conscious effort.
</p>
<p>
Surely we can benefit from the immense computing and memory capabilities of the computer?
</p>
<p>
So I figured that I wanted:
</p>

A web surfing companion. A copilot.

Call it whatever you like, I <i>wish</i> it was a concept with a widely accepted name. Something that will:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
aid me with <b>information processing</b>
</p>
<p>
Keep track of what I've read, when, on what device, and for how long.
</p></li>
<li><p>
show me my <b>annotations and highlights</b>, within the original page
</p>
<p>
I don't want to keep wondering whether I got my notes and thoughts stashed in some app, I want the computer to let me know instead.
</p></li>
<li><p>
unify my <b>scattered and siloed bookmarks</b>
</p>
<p>
Firefox bookmarks; Reddit/Hackernews saves; "Watch later" on Youtube, saved links in your instant messenger.
</p>
<p>
These are the same damn thing, yet there is no way to oversee and process them through a single interface.
<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  JB something about 'universal queue'?</span>
</p></li>
<li><p>
connect with my online presence: chats and social networks
</p>
<p>
If I've tweeted about a page, surely this fact should be present in the browser history?
In fact, it's <b>way</b> more important than a simple browser visit.
</p></li>
<li><p>
help me to explore new information and <b>prioritize</b> it
</p>
<p>
There is so much awesome stuff on the Internet! The biggest problem I have is picking the next cool link to dig into.
</p>
<p>
I wish there was something that could <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  with a single click?</span> show me, who of my friends, or of the people I follow, have read a certain link.
What did they think? Have they posted about it, annotated, or something else? Do they follow the author?
</p></li>
<li><p>
bridge the gap between the browser and my private wiki
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  elaborate? not sure if many people understand what's a private wiki</span>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I wanted a system like this <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/767412935316611072">for</a> several <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/896313846159298560">years</a>.
</p>
<p>
At some point, after failed attempts at finding an existing solution, I'd figured that it was going to be a yet another thing I had to implement myself.
</p>
<p>
The journey of building this took longer than I expected, led me through a rabbit hole of <a href="./tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a>, lots of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a>,
and made me realize: <b>browser history is very, very broken</b>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="history_broken"><a class="headerlink" href="#history_broken">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Browser history is broken</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-history_broken">
<p>
Web browser history is a rich source of potentially useful information.
Just think about it: it's zero effort <a href="./tags.html#lifelogging">lifelogging</a>.
It contains exact timestamps and links which <i>basically</i> address information.
</p>
<p>
To a large extent, URLs express relationships <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: like person/group/post/comment/etc.. elaborate</span>, and again, with pretty much zero effort – it's the way web works.
Seems like a <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: rich/ripe ??? for ???</span>, right?
You should be able to easily find the information relevant to the current page and be able to easily trace your jumps through the websites.
</p>
<p>
Now think what experience do you have instead. What was the last time you used it in any nontrivial way, for something other than reopening an accidentally closed tab?
</p>
<p>
Besides:

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="not_just_browser"><a class="headerlink" href="#not_just_browser">¶</a>it's not just about web browsers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-not_just_browser">
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
If you're using a native phone app (say, for Reddit or Twitter), your history either isn't logged anywhere or stored locally on your phone.

</span><aside class="sidenote">this is why I emphasize <b>browsing</b> history, not <b>browser</b> history</aside></div>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
On Android, it's likely to be in an Sqlite database in <code class="inline">/data/data/app.name</code>.
This directory is not accessible to normal users <b>unless your phone is rooted</b>.
Just think about how ridiculous it is. It's <b>your own data</b>, yet your OS babysits you and prevents you from accessing it.

</span><aside class="sidenote">rooting Android phones ranges from "<b>somewhat</b> painful" to "<b>very</b> painful"</aside></div>
<p>
As a specific example, <a href="https://github.com/ccrama/Slide">Reddit Slide</a> app keeps the view history in <code class="inline">/data/data/me.ccrama.redditslide/SEEN</code>.
Even if you root your phone and can access the database, because <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  model is flawed something something</span>
the app isn't persisting the data in the database, it's merely keeping a few weeks cache.
So if you want your complete history, you have to backup this database regularly, keep the snapshots and <a href="exports.html#synthetic">somehow</a>
reconstruct it.
</p>
<p>
You may dismiss this as data <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: nitpicking? not sure what's a good word</span>, but when <b>all</b> of your phone apps are doing this, you're missing out on quite a lot of information.

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="siloed"><a class="headerlink" href="#siloed">¶</a>it's scattered and siloed</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-siloed">
<p>
Continuing the previous point:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for the most part, you can't access history in your phone apps</li>
<li><p>
lots of data which is <i>ought</i> to be counted as web history is scattered across silos
</p>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
It sits behind the APIs (best case), GDPR and manual exports (worst case)
and hard to get hands on, <i>even</i> if you're an experienced software engineer.

</span><aside class="sidenote"><a href="sad-infra.html">#sadinfra</a></aside></div>
<p>
It idles on your filesystem in markdown and org-mode files.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Even <i>regular</i> browser history is not easy to get::
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1080942">used to</a> silently 'expire' your browser history</li>
<li><p>
Chrome deletes history older than <a href="https://superuser.com/a/364475/300795">90 days</a>
</p>
<p>
The only way to access older history I'm aware of is <a href="https://myactivity.google.com">Google Activity</a> and Takeout.
</p></li>
<li>Google Takeout <a href="./takeout-data-gone.html">quietly recycles your history</a></li>
<li><p>
Migration is limited to the most popular browsers
</p>
<p>
The retention limits the migration as well.
E.g. if you migrate from Chrome to Firefox, the history older than 90 days is locked and siloed in your Google Account.
</p></li>
<li><p>
You're gonna have a hard time if you're not using Google/Mozilla sync
</p>
<p>
Your history will be scattered across devices and lost on OS reinstalls.
</p>
<p>
There are ways of self-hosting Firefox sync, and (<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/614744/how-to-set-up-a-own-chrome-sync-server">allegedly</a>) even Chrome sync,
but, as you can imagine, it's quite tedious.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="weight"><a class="headerlink" href="#weight">¶</a>it's got different weight</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-weight">
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  not sure about 'weight'</span>
</p>
<p>
Not all links in your history are equal (on equal/the same grounds??).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>some are clicked on by accident</li>
<li>some you've just skimmed</li>
<li>some are on your reading list</li>
<li>some you've been reading for hours and they are full of your highlights and annotations</li>
<li>some you are keeping in your knowledge base/personal wiki</li>
<li>some of them you've shared with other people on social media</li>
</ul>
<p>
The current browser history experience makes absolutely no difference between these scenarios.

<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="urls_broken"><a class="headerlink" href="#urls_broken">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">4</span> URLs are broken</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-urls_broken">
<p>
This topic deserves a separate post <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: someone surely must have ranted about it?</span>, but I'll keep it a section size for now.
</p>
<p>
URLs seem great because they mostly address content, and semi-curated. In reality though:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
links <b>rot</b>
</p>
<p>
Many URLs are <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Archiving-URLs#link-rot"><b>literally</b> broken</a>.
We're lucky to have <a href="https://web.archive.org">archive.org</a>, so you can at least access dead pages.
</p>
<p>
But there is no way to migrate your browser history, e.g. point to archive.org entry or a new domain.
Similarly, if you had the page annotated, your annotations orphan, and usually, there is usually no easy way to re-point them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>obfuscated</b> by shortening and redirects
</p>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
What happens to all the <code class="inline">t.co</code> links when Twitter as a service dies?

</span><aside class="sidenote">see <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo#Linkwrapping">linkwrapping</a></aside></div></li>
<li><p>
<b>obscured</b>
</p>
<p>
For example, there is no easy way to know what is behind <code class="inline">https://www.instapaper.com/read/1265139707</code>, without querying the Instapaper API.
</p>
<p>
Relations between data are often obscured by URLs. For example, these two links:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code class="inline">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22918980</code> is a submission link</li>
<li><code class="inline">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22919718</code> is a comment to that submission</li>
</ul>
<p>
These links are clearly related, but there is no way to tell it just from <samp class="inline">id</samp>.
</p>
<p>
Compare this to Reddit links:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code class="inline">https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is</code> is a post link</li>
<li><code class="inline">https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is/fo9qnen</code> is a comment to that post</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ids are obscure, but at least we can clearly see the <code class="inline">post &lt;-&gt; comment</code> relation just by looking at URL.
Alas, the browsers are just ignoring this quite useful information.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>unstandardized</b>
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">queries</a>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>typically they don't represent anything persistent and are used for querying (duh)</li>
<li>sometimes they are used to address information: <code class="inline">http://wiki.c2.com/?LispLanguage</code> or <code class="inline">https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2694</code></li>
<li>and in many cases, they are utter garbage used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Tracking">tracking</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The worst part is that these usecases interleave. For example, take a look at <code class="inline">youtube.com/watch?v=wHrCkyoe72U&amp;feature=share&amp;time_continue=6</code>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code class="inline">v=wHrCkyoe72U</code> is the most important part about this link</li>
<li><code class="inline">feature=share</code> is just garbage</li>
<li><code class="inline">time_continue=6</code> could be treated as useful information</li>
</ul>
<p>
A similar story applies to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier">fragments</a>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>on Google groups, they are meaningful and address specific discussions and messages: <code class="inline">https://groups.google.com/a/list.hypothes.is/forum/#!topic/dev/kcmS7H8ssis</code></li>
<li>on most websites, they refer to the content within a page: <code class="inline">https://github.com/lipoja/URLExtract/issues/13#issuecomment-467635302</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>unnormalized</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>just think of all the <samp class="inline">www.</samp>, <samp class="inline">amp.</samp>, <samp class="inline">mobile.</samp>, <samp class="inline">m.</samp> garbage</li>
<li><code class="inline">youtu.be/1TKSfAkWWN0</code>, <code class="inline">youtube.com/embed/1TKSfAkWWN0</code> and <code class="inline">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0&amp;list=WL&amp;index=11</code> refer to the exact same content, yet your browser has no idea.</li>

<a href="https://github.com/novoid/Memacs#readme">Memacs</a> by Karl Voit
</p>
<p>
Memacs is a memex, which unifies your data as org-mode, allowing for querying in from within Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, that means you have to query information actively in your emacs, as opposed to a passive assistant that does it for you.
</p>
<p>
In addition, keeping everything in org-mode will be inefficient for long browsing histories with hundreds of thousands of entries.

This is a working (but not open-source, at least yet) prototype of a Memex, unifying personal data and exposing an API for it.
</p>
<p>
I only ran at it a few months ago! Because it's not public, I'm not sure to which extent it can address the browser history problem specifically.
But jumping a bit ahead, I expect it to integrate well with <a class="link-down" href="#promnesia">Promnesia</a>, so we could benefit from each other's work.

<p>
There is a family of Chrome extensions similar to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-trends-unlimited/pnmchffiealhkdloeffcdnbgdnedheme">History Trends Unlimited</a>,
which try to make up for Chrome 90-day retention by keeping the history in IndexDB.
The only problem they solve is the said retention, and it ends up as a yet another silo.
</p>
<p>
But at least, thousands of users means there is a demand for such functionality.

I mentioned it already, but considering that many people use it, it worth a separate mention. Its problems are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it's a Google-specific silo, and the functionality provided by Google is only useful for deliberate searches</li>
<li>it doesn't have an API, and can't be integrated in the browser</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex#memex-features">Worldbrain Memex</a> is a very cool browser extension.
It's open source, keeps your history, supports tagging, highlights, annotation, and even full-text search.
By all means, try it!
</p>
<p>
The only problem is that Memex is that it's also kind of a silo.
I really hate using the word "silo" here, because in my mind it's an insult.
If anything, Memex is probably <b>the nicest silo</b> I know of. It keeps data locally, it's got data imports from other services.
</p>
<p>
But nevertheless, if you commit to using it, you have to move the data into Memex, and conform it to its model.
</p>
<p>
If for some reason you can't or don't want to use Memex for annotating and recording all of your history (e.g. on some of your devices) – you <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO: what did I want to say here?</span>
</p>
<p>
In summary, a nice tool is great, but what I want is a different <b>model</b> of interacting with my <b>existing</b> data, which doesn't require moving the data in-between the silos.
(see <a class="link-up" href="#not_just_browser">"it's not just about the browser"</a>)
</p>
<p>
And jumping ahead again, <a class="link-down" href="#promnesia">Promnesia</a> can be used with Memex data. In the future, I'll check out if we can benefit from each other's work.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-promnesia">
<p>
Ok enough rants! <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promneisa">Promnesia</a> is the tool I've developed to address some of the issues with the browsing history I've mentioned.
</p>
<p>
I've already <a class="link-up" href="#what_i_want">mentioned</a> what I wanted, but I'll recap:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a class="link-up" href="#history_broken">make the history useful</a>: unify scattered and siloed history under a single interface
</p>
<p>
There should be absolutely no difference between the link you opened yesterday in your Instapaper phone app,
and a link you visited in Firefox ten years ago.
</p></li>
<li><a class="link-up" href="#urls_broken">make the URLs useful</a>: benefit from the hierarchy and relations between them</li>
<li>assist me at exploring new information</li>
<li><p>
make it possible to easily trace through the history
</p>
<p>
Let me answer, when, how, and why have I visited/bookmarked the page?
</p></li>
<li><p>
integrate the metadata: annotations, highlights, notes, chat messages, tweets, etc. Display it right within the page when applicable (e.g. highlights)
</p>
<p>
Make webpages context-aware and embed the <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  other digital?? walled gardens?</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  release from silos?</span>
</p></li>
<li><p>
make it flexible
</p>
<p>
As long as it's <i>something</i> you can extract URLs from, you should be able to feed it in Promnesia.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Here, I'm cheating a little bit, because some of these goals weren't clear from the beginning – I had understood them during the development.
</p>
<p>
There are also some meta-goals and principles I'm adhering:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
make it open source
</p>
<p>
That goes without saying, everything I'm doing for this project is shared and open source.
Francly, I don't believe this can be sustainable any other way.
</p></li>
<li><p>
local first
</p>
<p>
Your past is sensitive data and you should have control where do you keep it and how you're accessing it.
In the simplest setup, promnesia talks to your browser through a <b>local</b> port.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  say smth about performance etc</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  it's even possible to use it offline (if your browser supported offline)</span>
</p></li>
<li><p>
make it modular
</p>
<p>
Make sure the components can be reused.
</p>
<p>
For the last several months, I've been mostly removing/moving away the code from Promnesia,
to make sure that the <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">data processing and normalization code</a> used in Promnesia can be used for other purposes by other people.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to take this even further and perhaps try to see if parts of Promnesia can be useful for:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://web.hypothes.is">Hypothes.is</a> project</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex#memex-features">Worldbrain Memex</a> project</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
don't build another silo, use existing information
</p>
<p>
This kind of complements the previous point.
</p>
<p>
There are many decent services and tools already. They all have their own <a href="annotating.html#comparison">pros and cons</a>.
Different people prefer different tool, sometimes because they're locked in and don't have much choice,
but sometimes because they genuinely have subtle preferences and opinions.
</p>
<p>
The cost of switching is too high, both in terms of the time and the cognitive effort.
There's always a risk that you'd encounter this one small thing that would make the tool a no-go.
</p>
<p>
We should invest in finding better ways of <b>combining</b> existing tools, not rewriting all over again.

<h2 id="how_to_use"><a class="headerlink" href="#how_to_use">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">7</span> How can you use Promnesia?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-how_to_use">
<p>
This is how I'm using it.
The <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#readme">README</a> also has screenshots and short screencasts which explain different features.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Finding new information
</p>
<p>
Example: I run into an <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/66/clockwork/haunted-by-his-brother-he-revolutionized-physics-rp">article</a> on Twitter. I enjoyed it, and the website looks kind of familiar.
</p>
<p>
When I jump on <a href="https://nautil.us">https://nautil.us</a>, the Promnesia sidebar shows me that I've visited and even annotated other articles on this site before!
</p>
<p>
So it seems worthy of an RSS subscription, which I do!
</p></li>
<li>Exploring people and communities

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
How often have I engaged with a certain blog in the past?
</p>
<p>
Which posts have I already seen or read? Did I like them?
Should I dive deeper?
</p></li>
<li>Same questions, but for twitter accounts, subreddits, youtube channels or anything similar</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Processing large amounts of information
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://pinboard.in/popular">Pinboard popular</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind">link compilations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://posobin.com/hn_classics">Hackernews 'classics'</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Display annotations and highlights from <b>any</b> service (e.g. Instapaper/Pocket), within the webpage</li>
<li>Personal digital archaeology and external memory

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why did I bookmark this youtube video? Who sent it to me?</li>
<li>How did I get on this forgotten tab?</li>
<li><p>
I'm sometimes annoyed by <code class="inline">@&lt;account&gt;</code> tweets. Should I unfollow them?
</p>
<p>
I.e. why did I follow them in the first place? Are they worth following overall? Do I like their tweets often or bookmark their links?
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Integrating with your knowledge base</li>
<li><p>
Tap into other's brains
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  demo?</span>
</p></li>
<li><p>
Unified browser history
</p>
<p>
I'm listing it as the last because the benefits of this are only apparent when you start using your data, not when it sits on your disk.
</p>
<p>
As you get more and more detailed history, the system becomes more useful.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fin"><a class="headerlink" href="#fin">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">8</span> ---</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-fin">
<p>
I've always expected my computer <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  not necessarily computer</span> to be a remembrance system.
Promnesia is a step I've taken to bring that future closer.
