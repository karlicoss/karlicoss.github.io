<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promneisa">Promnesia</a> is a browser extension (Chrome/Firefox/Firefox mobile) which serves as a web surfing copilot,
enhancing your browsing history, improving the web exploration experience and integrating it with your knowledge base.
</p>
<p>
The repository contains some demos and the setup guide, this post is more of a motivation and the story of what has led me to work on it.
</p>
<p>
I've been raised on science fiction, and growing up, I've been dreaming about the technology drastically changing our lives.
Augmenting the brain with a math coprocessor, neural interfaces, having perfect reaction and memory – many of you are on the same page and know the drill.
</p>
<p>
Years had passed, I became a software engineer and had realised, how far are we from all these fancy technologies I wanted.
So my dreams? (TODO) have become more modest, and I've chosen a more realistic and plausible target: using my digital trace like browser history to compensate for my limited memory.
</p>
<p>
I'm exploring lots of information on the Internet, and it feels wasteful to use my meat resources (TODO tag) to keep track of it.
Web browsers tracks it automatically, without any manual and conscious effort.
</p>
<p>
Surely we can benefit from the immense computing and memory capabilities of the computer?
</p>
<p>
So I figured that I wanted:
</p>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0000000"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000000">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">1</span> I want a browsing assistant</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
A copilot. A web surfing companion. A <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html">Remembrance Agent</a>.
Call it whatever you like, I <i>wish</i> it was a concept with a widely accepted name.
</p>
<p>
Something that would:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
aid me with information <b>processing</b>
</p>
<p>
Keep track of what I've read, on what device, and for how long.
</p></li>
<li><p>
show me my <b>annotations and highlights</b>, within the original page
</p>
<p>
I don't want to keep wondering whether I got my throughts stashed in some app. (TODO)
</p></li>
<li><p>
help me to explore new information and <b>prioritize</b> it
</p>
<p>
There is lots of awesome stuff on the Internet and the biggest problem I have is picking the most relevant things to dig in.
</p>
<p>
I wish there was something that could in a single click show me, who of my friends, or of the people I follow, have read a certain link.
What did they think? Have they posted about it, annotated or something else?
</p></li>
<li>link/connect together TODO</li>
<li><p>
unify my <b>scattered and siloed bookmarks</b>
</p>
<p>
Browser bookmarks; Reddit/Hackernews saves; "Watch later" on Youtube, saved links in your instant messenger.
</p>
<p>
These are the same damn thing, yet there is no way to oversee and process them through a single interface.
</p></li>
<li>bridge the gap between the browser and my private wiki</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wanted a system like this <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/767412935316611072">for</a> several <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/896313846159298560">years</a>.
</p>
<p>
At some point, after failed attempts at finding an existing solution (TODO link), I'd figured that it was going to be a yet another thing I had to implement myself.
</p>
<p>
The journey to build this took longer than I expected, led me theought a rabbithole and lots of yak shaving,
and made me realize: <b>browser history is very, very broken</b>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0000004"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000004">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Browser history is broken</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Browsing history is a rich source of potentially useful information.
Just think about it: it's lifelogging for free.
It contains exact timestamps and links which <i>basically</i> address information.
</p>
<p>
To some extent, URLs express relationships like persons/groups/TODO?? we have for free.
Seems like a rich/ripe TODO for TODO, right?
You should be able to know TODO, associate TODO, and be able to easily trace your jumps through the websites.
</p>
<p>
Now think what experience do you have instead. What was the last time you used it in any nontrivial way, for something other than reopening an accidentally closed tab?
</p>
<p>
In addition:
</p>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0000001"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000001">¶</a>it's not just about web browsers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
If you're using a native phone app (say, for Reddit or Twitter), you history either isn't logged anywhere or stored locally on your phone.
</p>
<div><span class="before-aside">
On Android, it's likely to be in an Sqlite database in <code class="inline">/data/data/app.name</code>.
This directory is not accessible to normal users, <b>unless your phone is rooted</b>.
Just think about how ridiculous it is. It's <b>your own data</b>, yet your OS babysits you and prevents your from accessing it.

</span><aside class="sidenote">rooting modern Android phones ranges from "<b>somewhat</b> painful" to "<b>very</b> painful"</aside></div>
<p>
As a specific example, <a href="https://github.com/ccrama/Slide">Reddit Slide</a> app keeps the view history in <samp class="inline">/data/data/me.ccrama.redditslide/SEEN</samp>.
Even if you root your phone and can access the database, because the model TODO data is flawed?? in the first place,
the app isn't persisting the data in the database, it's merely a cache TODO latest few weeks or something?
So if you want your complete history, you have to backup this database regularly, keep the snapshots and <a href="exports.html#synthetic">somehow</a>
reconstruct it.
</p>
<p>
You may dismiss this as data nitpicking, but when <b>all</b> of your phone apps are doing this, you're missing out on quite a lot of information.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0000002"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000002">¶</a>it's scattered and siloed</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
It kind of continues the previous point:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for the most part, you can't access history in your phone apps</li>
<li><p>
lots of data which count be counted basically browser is scattered across the TODO
</p>
<p>
(TODO link to sad infra?)
</p>
<p>
It sits behind the countless APIs and TODO
</p>
<p>
It idles on your filesystem in markdown and org-mode files.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Even <i>regular</i> browser history is not easy to get hands on:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1080942">used to</a> silently 'expire' your browser history</li>
<li><p>
Chrome deletes history older than <a href="https://superuser.com/a/364475/300795">90 days</a>
</p>
<p>
The only way to access older history I'm aware of is <a href="https://myactivity.google.com">Google Activity</a> and Takeout.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Google Takeout quietly recycles your history
</p>
<p>
TODO link
</p></li>
<li><p>
Migration is limited to the most popular browsers
</p>
<p>
The retention limits the migration as well.
E.g. if you migrate from Chrome to Firefox, the history older than 90 days is locked and siloed in your Google Account.
</p></li>
<li><p>
You're gonna have hard time if you're not using Google/Mozilla sync
</p>
<p>
Your history will be scattered across devices and lost on OS reinstalls.
</p>
<p>
There are ways of selfhosting Firefox sync, and (<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/614744/how-to-set-up-a-own-chrome-sync-server">allegedly</a>) even Chrome sync,
but, as you can imagine, it's quite tedious.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0000003"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000003">¶</a>it's got different weight (TODO not sure about 'weight'?)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Not all links in your history are equal (on equal/the same grounds??).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>some are clicked on by accident</li>
<li>some you've just skimmed</li>
<li>some are on your reading list</li>
<li>some you've been reading for hours and they are full of your highlights and annotations</li>
<li>some you are keeping in your knowledge base/personal wiki</li>
<li>some of them you've shared with other people on social media</li>
</ul>
<p>
The current browser history experience makes absolutely no difference between these scenarios.

<h2 id="org0000005"><a class="headerlink" href="#org0000005">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">3</span> URLs are broken</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
This topic deserves a separate post (TODO someone suremy must have ranted about it), but I'll keep it a section size for now.
</p>
<p>
URLs seem great because they mostly address content, and semi-curated. In reality though:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Links rot
</p>
<p>
Many URLs are <b>literally</b> broken.

There is no way to migrate your browser history, e.g. point to archive.org entry or a new domain.

<p>

</p>
<p>
What happens to all the <code class="inline">t.co</code> links when Twitter as a service dies?
</p></li>
<li><p>

<p>
For example, there is no way to know what is behind <samp class="inline">https://www.instapaper.com/read/1265139707</samp>
</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
unstandartized
</p>
<p>
For example, fragments (TODO link):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>on google groups they are meaningful and address specific discussions and messages: <code class="inline">https://groups.google.com/a/list.hypothes.is/forum/#!topic/dev/kcmS7H8ssis</code></li>
<li>on most websites they refer to the content within a page: <code class="inline">https://github.com/lipoja/URLExtract/issues/13#issuecomment-467635302</code></li>
<li>and on many they are utter garbage and only there for tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>
TODO same point applies to query
</p></li>
<li>unnormalized

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>just think of all the <samp class="inline">www.</samp>, <samp class="inline">amp.</samp>, <samp class="inline">mobile.</samp>, <samp class="inline">m.</samp> garbage</li>
<li><code class="inline">youtu.be/1TKSfAkWWN0</code>, <code class="inline">youtube.com/embed/1TKSfAkWWN0</code> and <code class="inline">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0&amp;list=WL&amp;index=11&amp;t=0s</code> refer to the exactly same content, yet your browser has no idea.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code class="inline">&lt;link rel="canonical"&gt;</code>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>often it's not not present</li>
<li>when it does, often not used properly</li>
<li>TODO can't know it without loading the page first?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
I want URLs to <b>address information</b> and <b>represent relations</b>. The current URL experience is far from ideal for this.

First, there is enough services out there. They all are somewhat good and have different pros and cons (TODO link to annotation post?)

What we need is a uniform way to interact with it

It's not even a prototype! It's a but raw, but it works for me, and there is no reason it won't work for you apart from some infrastructural overhead.
I would like to raise a discussion on making this easier. I appreciate it may still be far from being possible to use by non-technical people, but at least my goal is so people who know/capable how to git clone and run from jobs could set this up

I didn't want to invent a new tool for annotation.
It's fragmented enough already and there are good tools out there already.
Cost of switching in time and cognitive effort is too high. There's always risk that you'd encounter this one small thing that would make the tool a no-go.

TODO Finding new information?

<p>
For example, I run into an <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/66/clockwork/haunted-by-his-brother-he-revolutionized-physics-rp">article</a> on Twitter. I enjoyed it, and the website looks kind of familiar.
</p>
<p>
When I jump on <a href="https://nautil.us">https://nautil.us</a>, the Promnesia sidebar shows me that I've visited and even annotated other articles on this site before!
</p>
<p>
So it seems worthy an RSS subscription, which I do!

<li>Exploring people and communities

How often have I engaged with this blog in the past?

<p>
Which posts have I already seen or read? Did I like them?

<li>Same questions, but for twitter accounts, subreddits, youtube channels or anything similar</li>

<li><p>
Processing large amounts of information

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why did I bookmark this youtube video? Who sent it to me?</li>
<li>How did I get on this forgotten tab?</li>
<li><p>
I'm sometimes annoyed by @&lt;account&gt;'s tweets. Should I unfollow them?
</p>
<p>
Why did I follow them in the first place? Are they worth following overall? Do I like their tweets often or bookmark their links?

I'm listing it the last, because its benefits are apparent only when you TODO want one of the above

<p>
As you get more and more detailed history, the system becomes more useful.
