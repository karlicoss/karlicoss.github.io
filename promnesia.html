Promnesia is a browser extension (Chrome/Firefox/Firefox mobile) that serves as a web surfing copilot
by enhancing your browsing history, improving your web exploration experience, and integrating with your knowledge base.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promneisa#readme">The repository</a> contains some demos and the setup guide, this post is more about the motivation and the story of what led me to work on it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-singularity_when">
<p>
I was raised on science fiction and grew up dreaming about technology drastically changing our lives.
Artificial intelligence, augmenting the brain with a math co-processor, head-up displays, neural interfaces, having perfect reaction and memory – many of you are on the same page and know the drill.
</p>
<p>
Years passed, I became a software engineer, and realized just how far we are from all these fancy technologies I wanted.
So my aspirations have become more modest, and I've chosen a more realistic and plausible target:
using my digital trace (such as browser history, webpage annotations and my <a href="./tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a>) to make up for my limited memory.
</p>
<p>
I'm exploring lots of information on the Internet, and it feels wasteful to use my <a href="./tags.html#meatsack">meat resources</a> to keep track of it.
Meanwhile, web browsers keep a record automatically, without any manual and conscious effort.
Surely we can benefit from the immense computing power and memory capabilities of computers?
</p>
<p>
So I figured that I wanted:
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="what_i_want"><a class="headerlink" href="#what_i_want">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Ok, maybe a web assistant at least?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what_i_want">
<p>
A web surfing companion. A copilot.

Call it whatever you like, I <i>wish</i> it were a concept with a widely accepted name. Something that will sit in my browser and:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
aid me with <b>information processing</b>
</p>
<p>
Keep track of what I've read, when, on which device, and for how long.
</p></li>
<li><p>
show me my <b>annotations and highlights</b>, within the original page
</p>
<p>
I don't want to keep wondering whether I have my notes and thoughts stashed in some app, I want the computer to let me know instead.
</p></li>
<li><p>
unify my <b>scattered and siloed bookmarks</b>
</p>
<p>
Firefox bookmarks; Reddit/Hackernews saves; "Watch later" on Youtube, saved links in my instant messenger.
</p>
<p>
These are the same damn thing, yet there is no way to oversee and process them through a single interface.
</p>
<p>

a post expanding further on this idea.
</p></li>
<li><p>
connect with my online presence: chats and social networks
</p>
<p>
If I tweeted about a page, surely this should be somehow recorded in the browsing history?
</p>
<p>
In fact, the page that I bothered to tweet about is <b>much</b> more important than a page I merely visited in the browser.
</p></li>
<li><p>
help me explore new information and <b>prioritize</b> it
</p>
<p>
There is so much awesome stuff on the Internet! The biggest problem I have is picking the next cool link to dig into.
</p>
<p>
Imagine if in one click, I could see which of my friends, or the people I follow have read a certain link.
What did they think? Have they posted about it, annotated, or something else? Do they follow the author, perhaps I should too?
</p></li>
<li><p>
bridge the gap between the browser and my <a href="./tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a>
</p>
<p>
Whatever product I choose for managing my notes: Google Keep, Evernote, Roam Research, or even org-mode files on my disk,
they always end up <b>isolated and disconnected</b> from my web browsing.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I searched for a system like this <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/767412935316611072">for</a> several <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/896313846159298560">years</a>.
</p>
<p>
After enough failed attempts at finding an <a class="link-down" href="#prior_art">existing solution</a>, I figured it was going to be yet another thing I'd have to implement myself.
</p>
<p>
The journey of building it took longer than I expected, led me through a rabbit hole of <a href="./tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a>, lots of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a>,
and made me realize: <b>browser history is very, very broken</b>.
</p>
<p>
Note: the next two sections are (somewhat technical) rants. If you prefer a more positive/less boring agenda, feel free to skip them straight to <a class="link-down" href="#prior_art">"Existing solutions"</a>
, and you can return back later if you feel like it.

<h2 id="history_broken"><a class="headerlink" href="#history_broken">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Browser history is broken</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-history_broken">
<p>
To a large extent, URLs express <b>relationships and hierarchy</b> between the bits of information. For example:  <code class="inline">blog &lt;-&gt; post &lt;-&gt; comment</code>, <code class="inline">person &lt;-&gt; tweet</code>, <code class="inline">playlist &lt;-&gt; video</code>.
</p>
<p>
With this information you should be easily able to find everything relevant to the current page and trace your jumps through past websites.
Merely by looking at URLs, without "AI" or some dubious machine learning algorithm!
Seems like a low hanging fruit to harvest, right?
</p>
<p>
Web browser history is a rich source of potentially useful information.
Just think about it: it's zero effort <a href="./tags.html#lifelogging">lifelogging</a>.
It contains exact timestamps and links which <i>basically</i> address information.
</p>
<p>
Now think about the experience you actually have. What was the last time you used the browser history in any nontrivial way, for something other than reopening an accidentally closed tab?
</p>
<p>
Besides:

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="not_just_browser"><a class="headerlink" href="#not_just_browser">¶</a>it's not just about web browsers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-not_just_browser">
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
When you're using a native phone app (say, for Reddit or Twitter), your history either isn't logged anywhere or if it is, it's only stored locally on your phone.

</span><aside class="sidenote">this is why I emphasize <b>browsing</b> history, not <b>browser</b> history</aside></div>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
On Android, it's likely to be in an Sqlite database in <code class="inline">/data/data/app.name</code>.
This directory is not accessible to normal users <b>unless your phone is rooted</b>.
Just think about how ridiculous this is. It's <b>your own data</b>, yet your OS babysits you, preventing access to it.

And yes, I know sandboxing and security are important, but locking my data inside the app is hardly an acceptable tradeoff.
</span><aside class="sidenote">rooting Android phones ranges from "<b>somewhat</b> painful" to "<b>very</b> painful"</aside></div>
<p>
As a specific example, the <a href="https://github.com/ccrama/Slide">Reddit Slide</a> app keeps your view history in <code class="inline">/data/data/me.ccrama.redditslide/SEEN</code>.
Okay, say you root your phone and access the database. Turns out the the app isn't persisting the data forever, it's merely keeping a few weeks' cache.
And I can hardly blame the developer for this: because of the data model, no one expects regular users to access this database.
</p>
<p>
So if you want your complete history, you have to backup this database regularly, keep the snapshots and <a href="exports.html#synthetic">somehow</a>
reconstruct it.
</p>
<p>
You may dismiss this as nitpicking and obsession over every last bit of my data.
But when <b>all</b> of your phone apps are doing this you're missing out on quite a lot of useful information.

<h3 id="siloed"><a class="headerlink" href="#siloed">¶</a>it's scattered and siloed</h3>

<p>
Building on the previous point:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for the most part, you can't access history in your phone apps</li>
<li>lots of data which <i>ought</i> to be counted as web history is scattered across silos

<ul class="org-ul">

on the filesystem, for example in markdown/org-mode files
</p>
<p>
A slightly better scenario, but as far as the web browser is concerned, it doesn't make any difference.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Even <i>regular</i> browser history is not easy to get:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1080942">used to</a> silently 'expire' your browser history</li>
<li><p>
Chrome deletes history older than <a href="https://superuser.com/a/364475/300795">90 days</a>
</p>
<p>
The only way to access older history I'm aware of is <a href="https://myactivity.google.com">Google Activity</a> and Takeout.
</p></li>
<li>Google Takeout <a href="./takeout-data-gone.html">quietly recycles your history</a></li>
<li><p>
Migration is limited to the most popular browsers
</p>
<p>
The retention limits the migration as well.
E.g. if you migrate from Chrome to Firefox, history older than 90 days is locked and siloed in your Google Account.
</p></li>
<li><p>
You're going to have a hard time if you're not using Google/Mozilla sync
</p>
<p>
Your history will be scattered across devices and lost on OS reinstalls.
</p>
<p>
There are ways of self-hosting Firefox sync, and (<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/614744/how-to-set-up-a-own-chrome-sync-server">allegedly</a>) even Chrome sync,
but as you can imagine, is quite tedious.

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="significance"><a class="headerlink" href="#significance">¶</a>it's got varying significance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-significance">
<p>
Not all links in your history are equally important:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>some are clicked on by accident</li>
<li>some you've just skimmed</li>
<li>some are on your reading list</li>
<li>some you've been reading for hours and are full of your highlights and annotations</li>
<li>some you reference in your knowledge base/personal wiki</li>
<li>some of them you've shared with others on social media</li>
</ul>
<p>
The current browser history experience makes no distinction between these scenarios.

<h2 id="urls_broken"><a class="headerlink" href="#urls_broken">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">4</span> URLs are broken</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-urls_broken">
<p>
This topic probably deserves a separate post, but I'll keep it section-sized for now.
</p>
<p>
URLs might seem great because they mostly address content and are semi-descriptive: people <i>try</i> to keep URLs somewhat reasonable, tidy and working.
But in the real world:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
links <b>rot</b>
</p>
<p>
Many URLs are <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Archiving-URLs#link-rot"><b>literally</b> broken</a>.
We're lucky to have <a href="https://web.archive.org">archive.org</a>, so you can at least access dead pages.
</p>
<p>
But there is no way to migrate your browser history, e.g. point old URLs to their respective archive.org entries or a new domain.
Similarly if you had the page annotated, your annotations become orphans without an easy way to relink them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>obfuscated</b> by shortening and redirects
</p>
<div style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px"><span class="before-aside">
What happens to all the <code class="inline">t.co</code> links when Twitter as a service dies?

</span><aside class="sidenote">see <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo#Linkwrapping">linkwrapping</a></aside></div></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>obscured</b>
</p>
<p>
There is no easy way to know what's behind <code class="inline">https://www.instapaper.com/read/1265139707</code> without querying the Instapaper API.
</p>
<p>
Relations between data are often obscured as well. For example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code class="inline">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22918980</code> is a submission link</li>
<li><code class="inline">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22919718</code> is a comment to that submission</li>
</ul>
<p>
These links are clearly related, but there is no way to tell it just from <samp class="inline">id</samp>.
</p>
<p>
Compare this to Reddit links:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code class="inline">https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is</code> is a post link</li>
<li><code class="inline">https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is/fo9qnen</code> is a comment to that post</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ids are obscure, but at least we can clearly see the <code class="inline">post &lt;-&gt; comment</code> relation merely by looking at the URLs.
Alas, browsers are just ignoring this useful information.
</p></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>unstandardized</b>
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">queries</a>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>typically don't point to anything persistent and are used for querying (duh)</li>
<li>but other times they are used to address information: <code class="inline">http://wiki.c2.com/?LispLanguage</code> or <code class="inline">https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2694</code></li>
<li>and in many cases are utter garbage used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Tracking">tracking</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The worst part is that these use cases overlap. For example, take a look at <code class="inline">youtube.com/watch?v=wHrCkyoe72U&amp;feature=share&amp;time_continue=6</code>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code class="inline">v=wHrCkyoe72U</code> is the most important part of this link</li>
<li><code class="inline">feature=share</code> is just garbage</li>
<li><code class="inline">time_continue=6</code> could be treated as useful information</li>
</ul>
<p>
A similar story applies to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier">fragments</a>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>on Google groups, they are meaningful and address specific discussions and messages: <code class="inline">https://groups.google.com/a/list.hypothes.is/forum/#!topic/dev/kcmS7H8ssis</code></li>
<li>on most websites, they refer to the content within a page: <code class="inline">https://github.com/lipoja/URLExtract/issues/13#issuecomment-467635302</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>links are <b>unnormalized</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>just think of all the <samp class="inline">www.</samp>, <samp class="inline">amp.</samp>, <samp class="inline">mobile.</samp>, <samp class="inline">m.</samp> garbage</li>
<li><code class="inline">youtu.be/1TKSfAkWWN0</code>, <code class="inline">youtube.com/embed/1TKSfAkWWN0</code> and <code class="inline">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0&amp;list=WL&amp;index=11</code> refer to the exact same content, yet your browser has no idea.</li>
<li><code class="inline">&lt;link rel="canonical" ...&gt;</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element">element</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>often it's not not present</li>
<li>when present, often used improperly,</li>
<li>you need to fetch the page first to get the canonical link</li>
<li>only works one way; you can't easily retrieve all links that have <b>the same canonical page</b> as the current</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

I want URLs to <b>address information</b> and <b>represent relations</b>. The current URL experience is far from ideal for this.

Unfortunately, that means you have to query information actively in your emacs, as opposed to a passive assistant doing it for you.
</p>
<p>
In addition, keeping everything in org-mode will be inefficient for long browsing histories with hundreds of thousands of entries.

<a href="https://hyfen.net/memex">Memex</a> by Andrew Louis
</p>
<p>
This is a working (but not open-source, at least yet) prototype of a Memex, unifying personal data and exposing an API for it.
</p>
<p>
I only ran into it a few months ago! Because it's not public, I'm not sure to what extent it can address the browser history problems specifically.
Jumping a bit ahead of myself, I expect it to integrate well with <a class="link-down" href="#promnesia">Promnesia</a>, so we could potentially benefit from each other's work.

<p>
There is a family of Chrome extensions similar to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-trends-unlimited/pnmchffiealhkdloeffcdnbgdnedheme">History Trends Unlimited</a>
which try to make up for Chrome's 90-day retention by keeping the history in IndexDB.
Unfortunately, retention is the only problem this solves, and then it it ends up as a yet another silo.
</p>
<p>
But, thousands of users indicates there is at least demand for such functionality.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-google">
<p>
Though I covered it already, it's worth another mention as many people use it. I find it problematic because:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it's a Google-specific silo, and the functionality provided by Google is only useful for deliberate searches</li>
<li>it doesn't have an API, and can't be integrated in the browser</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3 id="worldbrain_memex"><a class="headerlink" href="#worldbrain_memex">¶</a>Worldbrain Memex</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex#memex-features">Worldbrain Memex</a> is a browser extension to annotate, search and organize what you've seen online,
and soon a <a href="https://community.worldbrain.io/t/new-testing-memex-mobile-app-sync/233">mobile app</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's an amazing product: open source, local first, supports tagging, highlights, annotations, and even full-text history search.
By all means, try it!
</p>
<p>
It would be pretty close to my vision of the personal web assistant if not for a problem: it is also a kind of a silo.
You can import the data from other services into Memex, but then you have to conform to its model of the data.
If for some reason you can't use Memex for annotating and recording your history (e.g. on some of your devices) – you
end up using multiple services, or having redundant (and potentially inconsistent) copies of your data scattered across your digital space.
</p>
<p>
Having privacy focused and open source tools is a very important step towards a better future.
However, I want a different <b>model</b> of interacting with my <b>existing</b> data, which doesn't require moving data in between the silos.
(see <a class="link-up" href="#not_just_browser">"it's not just about the browser"</a>)
</p>
<p>
And jumping ahead again, <a class="link-down" href="#promnesia">Promnesia</a> can be integrated with Memex.
Overall, it seems that our vision is pretty similar, and I expect that both projects can benefit <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red; background: yellow">TODO:  link to the 'future' paragraph</span> from each other's work
(up to the point that Promnesia extension is merged into Worldbrain Memex extension, or can be running against its backend).

<h2 id="promnesia"><a class="headerlink" href="#promnesia">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Hello, Promnesia!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-promnesia">
<p>
Ok enough rants! <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promneisa">Promnesia</a> is the tool I've developed to address some of the issues with the browsing history and URLs.
</p>
<p>
I've already <a class="link-up" href="#what_i_want">mentioned</a> what I wanted, but I'll recap:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a class="link-up" href="#history_broken">make history useful</a>: unify scattered and siloed history under a single interface
</p>
<p>
There should be absolutely no difference between a link you opened yesterday in your Instapaper phone app,
and a link you visited in Firefox ten years ago.
</p></li>
<li><a class="link-up" href="#urls_broken">make URLs useful</a>: make use of their hierarchy and relations between them</li>
<li>assist me in exploring new information</li>
<li><p>
make it possible to easily trace my history
</p>
<p>
Let me answer when, how, and why did I visit/bookmark the page?
</p></li>
<li><p>
integrate metadata: annotations, highlights, notes, chat messages, tweets, etc.
</p>
<p>
Release it from walled gardens and display it right within the page when applicable (e.g. highlights)
</p></li>
<li><p>
make it flexible
</p>
<p>
As long as it's <i>something</i> you can extract URLs from, you should be able to feed it in Promnesia.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
A cool thing is that some of these goals weren't clear from the beginning – I discovered them during development,
and I think there are many more I haven't discovered yet!
</p>
<p>
There are also some <b>meta-goals</b> and principles I'm adhering to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
make it <b>open source</b>
</p>
<p>
This goes without saying: everything I'm doing for this project is shared and open source.
Frankly, I'm not even sure such a project can be sustainable any other way.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>local first</b>
</p>
<p>
Your past is sensitive data and you should have control over where you keep it and how you're accessing it.
In the simplest setup, promnesia communicates with your browser through a <b>local</b> port.
</p>
<p>
In addition, you have all your data available <a class="post-tag" href="./tags.html#offline">#offline</a>.
Modern browsers provide a pretty pathetic offline experience, but if you use a tool similar to <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox">ArchiveBox</a>, this can be useful to you.
</p></li>
<li><p>
make it <b>modular</b>
</p>
<p>
Make sure components can be reused.
</p>
<p>
For the past several months, I've mostly been removing/moving away the code from Promnesia
to make sure that the <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">data processing and normalization code</a> in it can be used for other purposes by other people.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to take this even further and perhaps try and see if parts of Promnesia might be useful for:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://web.hypothes.is">Hypothes.is</a> project</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex#memex-features">Worldbrain Memex</a> project</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<b>don't build another silo</b>, use existing information
</p>
<p>
This kind of complements the previous point.
</p>
<p>
There are many decent services and tools already. They all have their own <a href="annotating.html#comparison">pros and cons</a>.
Different people prefer different tools. Sometimes because they're locked in and don't have much choice,
but other times because they genuinely have subtle preferences and opinions.
</p>
<p>
The cost of switching is too high, both in terms of the time and the cognitive effort.
There's always the risk of encountering <i>one small thing</i> that would make the tool a no-go.
</p>
<p>
We should invest in finding better ways of <b>combining</b> existing tools, not rewriting all over again.
</p></li>

<div class="outline-2">
<h2 id="how_to_use"><a class="headerlink" href="#how_to_use">¶</a><span class="section-number-2">7</span> How can you use Promnesia?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-how_to_use">
<p>
Here I'll describe some specific scenarios for which I find Promnesia extremely useful.
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#readme">README</a> also has screenshots and short screencasts which elaborate on the features.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Finding new information
</p>
<p>
Example: I run into an <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/66/clockwork/haunted-by-his-brother-he-revolutionized-physics-rp">article</a> on Twitter. I enjoyed it, and the website looks kind of familiar.
</p>
<p>
When I jump on <a href="https://nautil.us">https://nautil.us</a>, the Promnesia sidebar shows me that I've visited and even annotated other articles on this site before!
</p>
<p>
I am repeatedly stumbling upon this site, and it's got high quality content, so I subscribe to it through my RSS reader.
</p></li>
<li>Exploring people and communities

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
How often have I engaged with a certain blog in the past?
</p>
<p>
Which posts have I already seen or read? Did I like them?
Should I dive deeper?
</p></li>
<li>Same questions, but for twitter accounts, subreddits, youtube channels or anything similar</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Processing large amounts of information
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://pinboard.in/popular">Pinboard popular</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind">link compilations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://posobin.com/hn_classics">Hackernews 'classics'</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Display annotations and highlights from <b>any</b> service (e.g. Instapaper/Pocket), within the webpage</li>
<li>Personal digital archaeology and external memory

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why did I bookmark this youtube video? Who sent it to me?</li>
<li>How did I get on this forgotten tab?</li>
<li><p>
I'm sometimes annoyed by <code class="inline">@&lt;account&gt;</code> tweets. Should I unfollow them?
</p>
<p>
I.e. why did I follow them in the first place? Are they worth following overall? Do I like their tweets often or bookmark their links?
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Integrating with your knowledge base
</p>
<p>
Promnesia can handle your private wiki whether it's plaintext, or a web service, which would help you instantly find and jump to the relevant information.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Integrating with others' knowledge bases
</p>
<p>
I find it intriguing to think about this as tapping into each other's brains!
</p>
<p>
See: <a href="myinfra-roam.html#promnesia">demo</a> integrating Promnesia with a Roam Research database.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Unified browser history
</p>
<p>
I'm listing it last because the benefits of this only become apparent when you start using your data, not while it just sits on your disk.
</p>
<p>
As you collect more and more detailed history, the whole system becomes more and more useful.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've always expected my gadgets to extend my ability to think and process information.
Promnesia is a step I've taken to bring that future closer.
